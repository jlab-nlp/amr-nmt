sorting - the waste container in brno smell not well
in prague , the people the drinks packaging sorting , in the south moravian villages will be back on step and sorting - waste , the container .
and in brno ?
reserve there would be a few minutes , in order to find the appropriate waste tonnes .
i will not say that the waste separation in brno would not work at all .
but it is me above , al if the gentlemen of the council is inadequate take care of this problem , even if we are the second biggest city in the republic .
brno is in the separate waste in the jungle league , not only because we as citizens here in the sorting container always only dispose of paper , glass and plastic must , but , above all , by the mülltonnen number for such waste .
you have some time in the centre tried , for example , the pet bottles in a basket of collection to dispose ?
that is the art , above all , it needs time and nerve .
accidentally found in the up to now , the only body , which i have taken is that of moravia place towards the goose .
mr onderka us his colleagues should not get angry , but for me , this is far too little .
apart from the fact that the waste separation is also in other parts not honey simple .
whole ranks my friends sorting this waste would prefer not to do anything .
from laziness .
it is that you too far to the waste tonnes .
i am not surprised .
i have even after the ceremony offered to dispose , a few glass and plastic bottles .
but on the konicova streets i have seen no colour mülltonnen in sight .
fortunately i came in road bahnfahren to the right place .
ran the waste but almost on .
this is but is still the centre of brno , thus making the whole city is represented , not true ?
however , ecology and any kind of aesthetics the brünner socialists probably cold .
buy they prefer the city of an ice hockey league , the us in the whole of the republic disgrace power , rather than a few tonnes of waste to buy more and to offer the sorting of further raw materials for a cleaner brno .
i am glad that i was able to confirm my assumption also with official statistics , after i have sought a while on the internet .
eko after the data of society - com is brno really in wholeheartedly district south moravia worst since .
the " paroubek ' - budget has the money for pensions and health money from
after the left - wing party despite the view of the government the farmers and officials , more money , is in the budget was no money for pensions , health and building society rules more money available .
but also for the state interest rates or not to blame for the international court disputes .
caused the which have more problems , the in the second half of next year will be of the government , the financial minister eduard janota says .
than the social democrats have enforced and communists the salary increase for some groups , they expect that the government , the money for the sensitive expenditure , pensions or for the health borrows money in addition . " this is only a postponement of the problems in the future , mines , " says janota .
from the loans will always pay higher interest rates , and we must exclude eventually have to return the money .
too much to choice , where take , the state coffers are empty .
if the social services or costs for the state are operating not be cut , to increase the tax .
for all the , which left - wing party now , the teachers were more money : the fire - fighters , the farmers .
and later also for their children .
with the pensions or the health of money , the account of 1.8 billion have disappeared , people must have no fear , they receive this money .
but at the price that the state debt - in the next year will be even more so in the state coffers lack not only 163 billion , but far more .
despite the efforts of the minister janota the debt will increase as more and more quickly and together with this also the cost and interest rates .
the state will need the money for the compensation , then already will no longer suffice to increase the value added tax slightly or to cut the maternity money , as the government in its against deficit - package .
externalisation because of the money be in favour of certain groups of voters in next year also five billion for lack of development of motorways and railways .
it is mainly the sections gained in the competition , the cannot be more new projektieren and perhaps cheaper .
received the most , which is also not free of charge .
this means late or suspension of thirty great buildings , is also the europe - money creation , the spokesman of the ministry of transport , karel warns hanzelka .
the cssd has proposed that solves it the flow of money afraid - it takes up the cez - stock dividends to , in which the state owners of the majority is , and then the money from this in the transport fund be paid out .
the problem is that the level of dividend is never certain and it is not a source of endless .
fins from last year cez 18 billion in the budget .
every year will be paid from the liquidations environmental damage - the dividends , topped up the pension account and this also serves as a reserve money for the planned pensions reform .
growing with this trick moreover , following the rules of the eu , the actual budget deficit to the nieveau of 5.7 % gdp .
so that ends the carnival of the changes but not yet .
almost three billion fell the budget for various compensation for victims of communism , and of criminal offences or for expenditure for the court disputes , even for the bausparen .
manage without this money , whether the state is not safe .
this is pure gambling .
if we lose an international court dispute , then we must which pay anyway , is janota clear .
save the money , then the minister , we must portfolio internally or in the worst case budget reserve attack the government .
one hundred million lack also for the two billion already begun ' treasury ' project , is intended to enable the on- line to monitor , for what the individual authorities spend the money .
launching the first stage in january .
should the finance ministers find the money not elsewhere , the project should be stopped and in this case , sanctions janota warned .

snow lack plaguing hotel owners on the mountains
scneelose pisten make sorgenn not only the giant mountains - residents .
the lack of snow discourages people also of the appointment of the ski stay in hotels and pensions .
therefore we can in giant mountains still free rooms for all winter deadlines incl . christmas and new year 's eve received .
visited our sides are often .
by the people go offers , note the prices , but they have now fear , binding to cultivate .
and if you ask us to call it immediately , whether our opinion after the christmas this year on snow or ' on matsch ' will be that the operators in the information portal spindl.info , martin jan dura .
who the new year 's eve - residence in the spindel mill exactly to his ideas , should not more with the appointment hesitate .
preferred who the save and in which the quality of the stay only in second place , of the can try to wait a few days for .
owners now offer the spindel mill hotel for the silvestertag largely only weeks stays .
i think , that they still a long time , will endeavour to sell this , but then they too must give , and on shorter times .
and then the free room will quickly dwindle , jan dura estimated .
free beds in all winter dates always provides always also the travel office ing tours in vrchlabi .
now we are most interested in the christmas week , which is not yet been sold out .
in our offer is approximately half of the jobs still freely .
therefore we have already prepared some cheaper christmas stays for the last moment , the director of the travel agents ing tours , petr schiefert .
the silvestertag in giant mountains the vrchlabi travel office can also offer here , but there is less free jobs .
good paragraph will also find the first fortnight in february , the rest of the winter deadlines be sold on average .
stays in this year is the interest for the winter also negatively affected by the fact that in giant mountains is always no snow .
the people are waiting , whether snow falls .
nobody wants to spend the year in the mountains without snow .
should the pisten within a week verschneit be , will also be the christmas compromising , believes schiefert .
reversed and a little better than in last year , it succeeds in the room in the hotel horizon pecpod snezkou to occupy .
we are about five per cent better than in the previous year .
on silvestertag and christmas we only have a few free rooms .
there are great interest in the polish holidays in the janua , and in february , the rules will also go well , informed the director of the best pec hotels , karel rada .
to 80 % for the new year 's eve stays is also the hotel omnia the central parking in janske lazne occupied .
christmas is to be against it in the most recent hotel in janske still half the beds free lazne .
pleasant struck us in the january this year , for the we are currently occupied already around 60 % .
now is a bit weaker the february , but at the moment is , if the snow , certainly also increases the interest in the visits to the giant mountains , the director of the hotels omnia , erik sporysch .
waiting for a greater snow mess the giant mountains hotel owners now .
cool down on thursday it should be and if there is rainfall , the snow on the mountains should be .
but then again a warming is supposed to come , informed jiri jakubsky from the location of the office in czech weather of the hradec kralove .
united states : repetition is mother of wisdom
it is almost funny , with what pupils strebsamkeit barack obama , the president with his reputation of the brightest , the strategy of his predecessor in the issue of afghanistan , repeatedly , the he felt even the most stupid .
when he finally its eagerly awaited afghanistan - doctrine ausschwitzte , it is that he showed this on the copying paper from the bush - iraq szenariovor abschrieb three years .
not only that he in the text itself on several occasions used the expression ' as in the iraq ' , it has even the name of the bush - declaration of january 2007 as the name of his own declaration : ' new way forward ' used , without hesitation .
he has even three years ago the bush idea - fresh troops quotas in the troubled by the civil war iraq to send in their conclusions , as the ' irresponsible and karastrophische criticised decision ' .
showed , however , that the following months of the recommendations of military outgoing bush strategy was the only possible and , in this respect , very successful today to be in the news that more not talking about iraq at all .
bush 's reputation this has not improved , because he has his successor objectively behind a much dankbarere starting situation , when it was to be expected .
barack obama in afghanistan hopes , that the miracle repeating itself .
in order to increase in the contingent of troops have him again asked the military , especially the upper stanley mccristal - general , the operation commander of the afghanistan - even despite the subordination habits the vacillating protect in the white house hard criticised .
he called for 40 000 soldiers , in order to be able to reverse the situation for the better .
the president hesitated three months , but it is to have a better idea and so he has the general wenistens 10,000 soldiers cheated .
pressed from europe he has the promise of another 5,000 , even if he himself at least with 10 000 , originally expected .
highly problematic to be the whole strategy of obama is projects , to withdraw the troops from afghanistan already in 18 months , and to conclude this process within three years . the whole obama - doctrine leaves than answers more questions .
some of us , doubt that the increase in the same effect as the measure halved in iraq will bring .
also despite the brother of recent years , is the iraq war - society relatively well - structured , their leaders honour the values .
the afghan situation is characterised by the counter indication - on no one can be kept and there will be no agreements rely .
in these conditions , it is difficult , prepare for the afghan security forces , which are accustomed , every day to change their mind .
the political institutions , even if they have been set up formally correct , remain only sham construction , which will excel towards the patriarchal tribal relations further .
the balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated , particularly due to the confusion of the conditions , the complicate the pakistan - and iran - influences even further .
also the building of a viable ' state ' , which is the minimalist aim of the whole operation , is unrealistic .
time horizon of the obama - strategy surprised by his voluntarism
over the last eight years , only in the situation in afghanistan has deteriorated further and now it is on the brink of explosion .
believe that the small soldiers , the in the war cries on the ' early return ' has broken out , are a miracle , can only create a really romantic soul , which will not impress of facts .
from the political view is the date for the withdrawal of troops mere irresponsibility , because the taliban , as the american defeat , receive the indirect confession .
the last nato summit showed that the willingness of europeans , to participate in the battles in afghanistan , is running out .
europe politicians can and want to also not explain to their voters , the way in which the security germany or italy with the war in the hindu kush , mountain connected .
another possible factor , the radically can influence the situation , is the development of the events in iran .
should continue to worsen the situation and the increased sanctions on the iranians not work , for the united states a very serious question arises whether the problem is not with troops to resolve .
this question must be answered in the period , in the america after obama withdrawal from afghanistan is the winner .
any solution but will also mean a dramatic turn of the afghan situation .
the only consolation plaster for barack obama is the fact that three years until the presidential election remain , and therefore remains enough time , so that it can resort to a other strategy , fallls this prove total default would .

light secret on norway dissolved : the russians have tested a missile
via norway was a special light effect of unknown origin to observe .
ministry of the russian defence has admitted that not only yesterday an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested the norwegian border .
but the launch was not successful and again the rocket described as ' bulava ' type , the originally should be the pride of the russian army , and the prime minister is slowly to the nightmare of the russian generals , vladimir putin .
also its repeated presence on the ground at the missile test has had no positive effect on the success of the test flights .
bulava is usually not launched at all or in the air has been damaged .
we have in the russian newspapers writes about ' bulava ' than a rocket ' that not flying ' .
not a rocket , the shining flies , but
this was already 13 attempt at the beginning of normal .
only again at the end of the flight are technical damage to the missile have emerged .
exploded probably the engine in the third stage missiles .
launched ' this time bulava ' from the nuclear submarine dmitri donskij , under the the water of the white sea , .
this raketentyp allows for the launch of the submarine - boat .
therefore , is probably that the mysterious light on north caused by an unspecified fliegendes object because in fact the damaged ' bulava ' was .
furthermore , the norwegians have for the first moment not doubt that it is a russian missile .
has this time the generals challenged not clearly and claims that we can talk of a failure .
were not from the first two stages of the missile and affected by the accident was only the third stage .
in the previous cases have been at the same time the engines in the first stage damaged .
even if not a test start without mistake , is the leadership of the ministry of defence only six of three ten for unsuccessful .
almost 50 % of the success that is why the generals met with optimism and it will continue to claimed that the ' bulava ' again fly without problems , and even to ten hyperschall - nuclear warheads with a total weight of max . will bear 1.15 tonnes .

czech discovery : a substance that is also in 's tempered 's hiv viruses
testing the team of czech and the german scientists , the new links should prevent the spread of hiv viruses in the body .
the main advantage of improved substance is that it is also in the viruses who already are resistant to medicines .
outweigh this fact against the disadvantage that the link in usual virus - does not so much variants , as one of the existing medicines .
the disease of aids can be cured not yet .
but the patients the compilation of medicines can extend the life and the increase in the hiv viruses in the body prevent .
their income will but accompanied by a number of side - effects .
incomplete oppression of the virus reproduction has also the development sg . resistant viruses to result , against the no medicines are more effective .
the work of the experts from three institutions of the academy of sciences cr , by the vscht ( chemically - technological university ) prague and by the university in heidelberg opens the way in which we can deal with the virus - resistance .
you have shown that the substances referred to as metalokarborane effect on the protein substance , the for proliferation of the hiv viruses responsible is .
the metalokarborane are links on boron , hydrogen , carbon and cobalt .
these links the virus reproduction block on all other than medicines used today , therefore , they can overcome the resistance - problem .
in their work the scientists to new 's improved 's links , on the basis of the knowledge of molecular mechanism their fixing on the viruses - protein substance were prepared .
the metalokarborane have a unique three - dimensional structure : two vielfächige cages , which from bor - , hydrogen - and carbon - atoms and by a metal - nuclear , in this case cobalt , are linked .
pet tückisches and lasting virus
protease hiv is protein substance of the hiv virus , the for the life cycle of the virus is essential .
without the hiv virus - caused by the hiv protease division would no tyres infection viruses particles .
if we switch off the hiv protease , we involve the increase in the body of the virus of the patients from , the scientists in the press , the report by the institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry of the academy of sciences cr was issued .
newspaper in the work in the science journal of medicinal chemistry was published , the scientists whole ranks of the describe links in which two couples the cages ( see table ) are linked by a brief organic chain , the then continues systematically to be changed .
weaker something , but reliable
the impact of this number of substances against the hiv - protease wurdne in a test tube tested , even against their constant ( resistant ) variants which have been won of hiv - infected patients .
the effect of the metalokarborane on the usual enzyme variant , is not so much as the medicines used clinically , however , will not lose their effects on the resistant variants , against the used the medicines are often ineffective .
the unique mechanism and their further characteristics , such as the biological and chemical stability , low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical shaping , power metalokarboranen to interesting links for further research , focused on the development of effective medicines against hiv says pavlina rezacova , leader of the laboratories for structural biology of the institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics of the institute of the academy of sciences .
dispute because budget . ods on fishing , the does
the chairman of the ods , mirek topolanek , the budget for the next year approved described as ' terrible ' and the government of prime by jan fischer should consider his opinion , their continued existence .
the expression of the ods the prime minister called as " strong worry " .
it is supposedly time for the analysis .
ods the vice - chairman , petr necas , said that the concept of the officials cabinet with the support of the ods and cssd , green party obviously no longer works .
after necas , the prime minister must decide whether he intends to rely in parliament to the minority , if it is the fight against the rising deficit , or whether it be in order to remain in office through the parliament left .
the approach of the ods and the social democrats , to the issue of the public deficits is diametrically differently , necas has pointed out .
parliament has adopted on wednesday the budget for the year 2010 , but with left - wing party - amendments on more than 12 billion kronor .
parliament has the money for state officials salaries , for the maintenance of social services and increased for direct payments to farmers .
has the government keeping to the proposals of the social democracy that they increase conceals the budget deficit .
czech republic should with a lagging behind by 163 billion kronor economies .
the ods has left the chamber before the vote , it is the wish of the government , because also the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provisional . frase emergency clear
disappointment and futility
of the finance ministers , edvard janota , has spoken on his disappointment and a sense of futility led , while prime jan fischer has judged that the government , the current situation .
necas is convinced that , if janota seriously threatened with his resignation for the case , that the amendment proposals were adopted , the situation would look different .
in accordance with the czech television has janota after the rules for monday government registered with the prime .
he has indicated that he be another remain in office .
reason to do so is his disappointment on the verhandugn of the budget .
extent to which fishermen for the further battle with the budget deficit , so that have in accordance with necas the nominanten social democracy , ( cssd ) , the amendments in the budget enforced , in the government had nothing to do .
the prime will also say clearly that he should resign , if parliament adopts continue deficit - enhancing laws , for example concerning the money , the health and pension , or the services law changed .
topolanek : the wrong by ods nominated minister not
it is a matter of the prime minister fishermen and the whole government .
the ministers have not made mistakes , nominated by the ods has topolanek highlighted in the text news from the united states .
it has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function people sitting , the commit to top 09 , the voted against the budget .
necas stressed that , if fishermen darür decides , to the fight against to abandon the deficit level of public finances , ' it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left - wing majority , which is currently in the parliament ' .
then he supposedly with the support and tolerance of the citizens democrats not can count .
i have not thought about it , and if it will be now , then i will deal so that , of the said citizens democrats nominated defence minister martin bartak the journalists in parliament .
prime fishermen afternoon the meeting of the european council flew to brussels .
the ods at the request of the prime minister resigned
necas at the same time , stressed that the ods probably on wednesday in the house would vote against the amended budget , if the prime the members of the citizens democrats would expressly ask that they enable the adoption of the budget .
we are not as orphaned children , we are not small children , so he responded then to the question of whether the ods in the political negotiating on the budget by its absence of the party chairman in the parliament and in the czech republic has not been pushed back .
i have not noticed that my vote would lack .
renounced the mandate as i already , i knew that it in next few months of the parliament and , above all , to bolshevism destruction everything would be positive , responded topolanek itself .
after the new road map of the cd ( czech rail ) will be fewer guidelines for roughly the same fare drive .
restricted the czech rail ended or from 13 december some less quickly - at full capacity and local trains , other connections will be strengthened against it .
the whole extent of transport will be applied from the day of the new road map in comparison with reduced by two % today .

to the greatest changes include the introduction of the new directly transport journey from de milo vice to prague , currently , the inhabitants de milo vice in lysa nad labem switch .
it is the five tenth transport way of the suburban transport system esko , whose opening thanks to the railway electrification from lysa nad labem after de milo vice is possible .
capital of the distance long- distance in the , in the end objective station prague - main station .
leads the cd more lines sc pendolino between prague and ostrava a and the trains to be sumperk / jesenik travel in the time of two hours .
with the pendolino since 13 december , the passengers can not go to bratislava again .
bill for this year 200 million increase in regional railways :
ordered the fast trains are and paid by the ministry of transport , as a whole receives the railway to reimburse the loss of so-called liquidity exact nature as four billion kronor in the next year , in this year . they pay the local trains supply the districts , as a whole for eight billion kronor in next year , with the state giving three billion .
in this year the regional guidelines are czech sek 200 million more expensive .
for the local guidelines , as well as the fast trains , the railway a ten - year treaty new , up to the treaty has now been completed always only concluded for a year .
praises the railway the system , perhaps that is why it has also not use of the increase in the price of the great majority of the tickets .
it is only to changes in day network fahrscheinen cd net and in favourable internet fahrscheinen eliska .

jan worry about raises cases of slander against three head the cssd .
the owner of the student agency , radim jan worry about that , today offence of defamation against three social - democratic leaders .
against michal hasek from the district of south moravia , from the district of radko martinek pardubice and the leader of the province of olomouc , martin tesarik .
jan worry about said this in a twenty - minute inteview journal on the radio .
the complaint is connected with the effort of the company , the regional - train transport to engage in a number of districts .
all regions have but ultimately the long- term contracts with the czech rail signed .
all three head are singling us and say that we pick the cherries , take it out , we have made the supply only about the scope , as it was voted with you .
they claim that we are expensive , as the czech railway , because we were aware of the prices of the czech rail , the last week have been completed .
remains so to defend ourselves nothing other than us .
because of this defamation of the society student agency , said jan worry about the radio journal .
at the same time , it led to that he has evidence from all the counties that their steps in accordance with the europe right , they have done .
that is why we are preparing a charge of the european commission .
hasek considers that the collection of the cases for the further the average show by jan worry about , the him as a free advertising for its society and for his own person serves .
of course i am prepared my good name and to defend the good reputation of my province , and i also call upon further head on .
i assume that will also be clear on this issue , that it jan worry about is , in the matter of the regional einsen rail transport and false manipulated public opinion and used false arguments , hasek said .
jan worry about reported last week that he have invested several million kroner in advertising , which is out to the detrimental step of the districts .

he stated that it will lead the campaign against the corruption as such .
initiated the campaign has jan worry about , after the districts at the instigation of the regional rail transport with the czech rail agreed and for the task in a high to 150 billion kronor no tenders had put out to tender .
after vancura is a sort of behaviour by illegal and in the contradiction with the requirements of the european court of justice .
because of the criticism of the rail transport in the districts of threatened him , according to jan worry about , also already a member of the cssd .
was the only threat , if we do not refrain that we can then also lose the bus licences .

vaccination against pneumokokken voluntarily free of charge , and
imfung against pneumokokken change from january the usual .
they should be first free of charge to the families and be voluntary .
but now to vote in that report the obligation - vaccination would be more effective .
the preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumokokken culminate .
institute of the medicinal products is already implementing the maximum prices have to pay the vaccines that the health insurance .
the experts are also on the vaccination procedure in the clear .
new vaccination
vaccines for august free - children
from january children can be vaccinated against pneumokokken free , on 2 august last year and later were born .
st the condition that they have not received any impfdosis yet .
who already with the vaccination in last year or earlier has begun , must also further repetition vaccination self- pay .
the first impfdosis between 3 and 5 life must be given month of the child .
already last year , a quarter of the families their children against pneumokokken vaccinate .
1600 paid the parents kroner and more for a dose .
needed for the vaccination of the youngest children are four doses .
as a whole , the experts estimate that the health insurance for the quantities 300 , 000 to spend sek 450 000 per year .
save you but in the treatment , which would need children without vaccination .
until now , the state has vaccination of children for all farmland spent around 500 000 per year .
the obligation - vaccination was introduced with the so-called janota - package .
ear cause pneumokokken resources pneumonia , but also serious infections including brain skin inflammations and blood poisoning .
by pneumokokken infections in us die after investigation in hospitals per year up to 28 children in 10 years of age .
outside of the czech republic , the duty - vaccination of children against pneumokokken was introduced in some 40 countries .
will be the vaccination duty ?
at the same time it is said that this vaccination in future duty could be .
from january it should be paid for by the insurance and voluntarily .
mentioned that the obligation - vaccination would be better , for example , the leader of the citizens ' association nahlas , mr rudolf kalovsky .
touted its association already pneumococcal vaccination in the long term .
the experts on the international conference , was involved in our union , were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination .
this is not very ideal .
on the other hand , we are glad that we have managed to enforce is , at least the .
i believe that that is the way the we must go now , led kalovsky .
wants to the ministry of health but the vaccination procedure against pneumokokken not change .
in this moment we consider the not at all , be vlastimil spokesman said sesen .
the voluntary vaccination has their disadvantages , claim the doctors .
doctors , the chairman of the specialist society of practical children hana cabrnochova , is that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks .
if all children would be vaccinated , then we could reflect on the reduction of the repetition vaccination number ' in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive , we understand the political decision that this was launched vaccination as a voluntary , " says allerdingst cabrnochova .
the experts expect that more than 80 % of the parents their babies against pneumokokken inoculated from next year .
vaccination against pneumokokken is path - breaking it is also that this as a first set vaccination will be paid for by the health insurance and not by the state .
the insurance should spend the money for the prevention , so that save it for further treatment , erkärt cabrnochova .
the doctors must buy the vaccines itself .
but that is a concern of the practical children doctors , the concerns the purchase the vaccines .
according to the original plans should be the vaccines bought by the insurance and the doctors this then to receive the same way , as well as other vaccines issued by the state to you .
some members have feared , however , that the insurance so ' the money from the health insurance could lead ' .
buy the doctors the vaccines itself and will therefore have to wait until the insurance you pay for them .
after the estimates , the individual practical will need to invest doctors per month sek 40 000 , which is a significant sum .
this will not be easy , says cabrnochova .

labour defended budget - and tax increases
the ministers have the tax hikes and spending freeze , were announced in the voretat report , against the criticism of the opposition , the economy and the trade unions defended .
conservatives said , alistair darling ' pass ' , would have an opportunity to show that it with the reduction of the deficit seriously he said , by the decisions until after the election , postponed .
chancellor of the exchequer , also for came under fire , that he aimed at of workers with low and middle - income .
to its main proposals include a 0.5 - % increase in social insurance and a 1 % wage capping border of the public for 2011 .
social insurance trouble
the trade unions have protested that low wage earners be punished for a recession , the they have not caused and warned against forthcoming ' problems ' .
the increase in the social insurance - to approximately gbp 3 billion per year – has angered the private economy , who says that this is a tax on jobs , while the emphasis should be on the economic recovery .
the increase , which is , the limited to those who earn more than £ 20 000 per year , will relate to roughly 10 million workers .
difficult points of the preliminary budget report
increase the social insurance by another 0.5 % from april 2011
in this year contraction of the economy by more than the expected 4.75 %
new 50 % tax on banker bonuses
1 % - increasing the corporate tax for small companies rejected
tax reductions for electric vehicles and wind turbines
2.5 % increase in the state pension
according to estimates of the treasury will someone with an annual income of £ 30,000 to £ 90 per year be poorer and someone with £ 40 000 per year will be £ 190 poorer , while a person with £ 10 000 year income to 110 £ will be richer .
halving the minister said , its objective of deficit until 2013 means ' difficult decisions , " but you also said that 60 % of the burden of additional taxes on the 5 % of the top income would remove .
financial minister stephen timms denied that the outlined tax hikes and spending freeze , compared to the necessary measures ' would be a drop in the ocean ' .
' these are large numbers . you will bring the deficit halving us and this is also on the period of the next four years is absolutely necessary ' he said the bbc with .
timms said that he is confident that the economy until the end of the year would return to the growth .
predictions of the labour party on the future economic growth – which the extent of the new debt and the speed of the deficit be influenced removal – were challenged , after chancellor of the exchequer was forced to revise , former figures .
he said in its opinion , the economy will probably be in this year to shrink 4.75 % - much more than the drop of 3.5 % , the in april was said earlier – while debt with £ 3 billion would be higher , than previously estimated .
' missed opportunity '
the conservatives , the , to want to start a new advertising campaign on thursday to warn against the " debt " crisis of labour , said that the planned debt of gbp 789 billion over the next six years is untenable .
you added that the ministers have failed to produce a credible plan , as you will pay back this , and ' cynically ' in difficult decisions until after the election - the must take place in june 2010 at the latest .
' you have nothing of importance , said about what they will make , ' said the shadow finance philip hammond . ' they had their own opportunity to do this , and you have leave it ' .
' the important announcements will not be made until after the election , whoever they win " .
roger bootle , deloitte
labour insists that schools , the hospitals , and the police from future cuts be preserved , unlike in the proposals of the conservative , what the deficit capping more quickly and more to see .
but the liberal democrats said , that the money that will be gained through the tax hikes and spending freeze , will be used , in order to cover the expenditure for the next year , not , in order to reduce the deficit , and argue , therefore , that the plans are built on sand ' . '
the political editor of the bbc , nick robinson , said that things at the time of the declarations - as the above inflation in the next april – adjustment in some invalidity pensions would suspend the charge of the vote fishing chancellor of the exchequer , simply because the money next year could be brought back .
labour insists , to provide the extra aid , when people truly need them most and that the situation in september 2010 will be re- examined .
' hollow budget '
although the ministers no budget details about 2011 , economists have announced , say that the pressure on public spending will come only in the medium term .
recognised the institute for tax investigations said , the figures the treasury chancellor would mean strong loss in many areas , future possibly also in the areas of transport , higher education , science and defence .

can the islam french be ?
pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state .
in a time , in the swiss voters voted in favour of a ban on building of minarets have and the concern about the alleged islamisation of europe is widespread , john bowen , an american academics , has written a sound and thoughtful report on whether to muslims in one of the most avowedly säkularisier societies europe can be integrated -- and be integrated .
some readers will this new book from admiration for the last work of the author : ' why the french no headscarves love ' ( original title : ' why the french don ' t like headscarves read ' ) ( 2006 ) , an elegant and densely argumentierenden study a dispute , the shared the country on one and a half decades and employees and their impact , are still exercise today .
bowen 's neustes book offers a broader and more kühneres range .
as a good anthropologist would he not only like to know what the politicians and the media , on the islam say in france , but what happens in the area really .
he has spent months in mosques , schools , and institutions , the now the 5 to 6 million muslims in france , as bowen calls it " islamic provide freedom ' .
he is listening , it is a good debates between teachers and students , on the questions of most concern to you .
should a muslim in a mosque or a town hall marry ( or both ) ?
young muslims should be lectured on evolution and rights of homosexuals ?
can a muslim mrs marry a man not muslim ?
it is for a muslim , permissible to use a rate of interest - oriented banking system , in order to get a mortgage ?
it is this seemingly mundane affairs gives , he claims , the daily life , in contrast to the political drama , the media .
the author , a new generation of imams acknowledges , teachers and intellectuals , none of them with a well - known behalf , possibly with the exception of tarik ramadan , a muslim - arab scholars and academics born in switzerland .
this new generation of trying to open up the debate on this , as it is possible , on the one hand , a good muslim citizens and , on the other hand , a good state to be in a modern secular society .
they have not all arguments on their side .
conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a french or european islam .
questioned the thinkers and activists , the bowen , with their salafi counterparts are usually divided – advocates of the puristischen sunni islam , which in connection with saudi arabia is – the nowadays a small but influential presence under europe muslims show .
bowen is of the opinion that muslim values could be compatible and french secularism .
however , a convention requires a give and take on both sides .
he queries to what extent french political decision - makers ( and the intellectual elite , guarded the so passionate the separation of church and state ) really feel committed to pluralism .
he suggests , that possibly a rougher treatment as the catholics , protestants muslims and jews know , the turn had to make their historic compromise with the secular republicanism .
he recognises a " tightening the screws of values " rather than a growing pragmatism .
islam can be french ? in the aftermath of the read this paper , it is inclined to say ' yes , but not yet ' .
most of the bleak outlook in the world
changing the arctic environment more quickly and in more dramatic than any other region on the earth .
marks that you , the ice cap melts and with an alarming rate is lives that can survive anywhere else .

richard ellis , a author and illustrator , is in ' on thin ice ' ( original title : ' on ice alcohol ' ) , a natural history of the icon of the north of the polar bears .
exercised in the history of the complicated and policy of whaling , he describes the long tradition of arctic erforscher , which have proved themselves in the quest for the polar bears .
admiral nelsons meeting with a polar bears as brave 14 -year-old fähnrich to sea , the only with the rifle butts of his muskete fought , is certainly a myth , but others are true .
young bears , which have been caught , as they behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers schwammenthal , were brought in zoos and circuses .
showed 75 polar bears a circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century in a vision .
even today zoo plants have still typically a millionth of the life of wild alttiers . the climate is rarely suitable : the polar bear in singapore was quite green of the algae , which in the hollow hair grow his fur .

ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians often and return to the threat , the hunters for the survival of species .
although in norway , america and russia , banned , it goes succumbed in greenland and canada , where hunters in helicopters and engine sleigh - travelling inuit powerful storm guns use , in order to bring their spoils to line .
ironically , in the waters of the north of these two hunting nations the ice the longest remain .
in his new book ' after the ice ' ( original entitled " after the ice ' ) offers alun anderson , a former editor of the scientific magazine ' new scientist ' , a clear and worrying description of the science of the arctic and a packenden insight , as the future could develop .
example , not that scientists have all the answers .
neither atmosphere scientists still ozeanografen can explain the speed of the changes appropriate .
this is but not in a lack of declaration try .

satellite surveys are a useful complement and the widespread application of messsonden on ice mountains , but is still much by brave people , the outside , achieved in the cold ' camp out ' .
anderson casts a view in the strange , tiny world of the influx of system within the arctic ice , the through saltwater rinnsale will be formed , the will be pressed together at the froze .
but , starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopic surprised in ice , all of them are under threat , once the summer passes , which is expected in the period between 2013 and 2050 .

sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country , in order to take prices , but this is always been rejected .

the news of the arrest of the new york times reported was first last friday night .
the new us policy attaches importance to the united states will provide a contribution , if the cuban government concrete steps in this direction , as release political prisoners and creation of more room for opposition .
mobile phones and notebooks are in cuba legally , even though you are new and coveted products in a country , in which the average earnings of an government employees $ 15 per month .
since this year , the cuban government only allowed normal citizens the purchase of a mobile phone , they are mainly used for text news , because a 15 - minute telephone conversation a daily wage would cost .

pakistani government representatives cover plan , to send men to afghanistan

saifullah following their arrival in pakistan , the leader of this men and tried to help them , the remote area to achieve in pakistan 's tribal belt , of the home of al qaeda and its terrorist training camps is .
but a representative of pakistan 's secret service , the of the matter has been informed , said on saturday , saifullah could not convince the al-qaeda leaders , that the men not part of a cia conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network are .
as a result , they were detained on days in the eastern city of sargodha , far removed from the inhospitable mountains in the north - west , which have become a terrorists refuge .

the case of the five men - which are still in pakistan and be consulted by the fbi - underlines the vital role of recruitment agencies in the identification of future terrorists and possibly even more importantly , in the decision , who is trustworthy .
since the attacks of 11 september 2001 , the us secret services to a matter of the utmost urgency , human asset made within of al qaeda .
recruiters act as guardians of organisation , the not let those who , whose commitment for the holy war is not seriously enough and such , could be the spies .

this is part of the motives , why i have decided to take part in the large demonstration - the floor in order to pass and to appeal to the world leader , to bring about a fair , ambitious and binding agreement , you said .
it is not an easy task , but it must be done now and there is no way leads more , the around it .

examination data show persistent racial gap
performance were welcome last week the certificates to mathematics good news for the public schools in washington d.c.
although the district washington is still far behind the schools of the country , the maximum services produce , the certificates show that the fourth and achtklässler faster progress than towns in the last two years , the atlanta , chicago and include new york , have made .
but what in the latest figures from the national evaluation of the educational progress ( including national assessment of educational programme - naep ) is , is the persistent performance divide between african - american and white pupils , both at local , and national level .
point of the average number of white viertklässler from washington d.c. rose in the last two years of 262 to 270 ( on a range of 500 ) , the their african - american counterparts , but only three points rose from 209 to 212 .
between 2007 and 2009 , in reality , the service gap rose from 53 to 58 points .
the progress of the african - american achtklässler remained in the basically the same , he fell by a statistically significant point from 245 to 244 .
the average number of point white pupils was not included in the test data was not big enough , because the spot scope .
the picture of a six - year period is also not encouraging .
separated the gap , the white and black viertklässler 2003 has been covered , as the first naep in this district , fraud 60 scale points ( 262 to 202 ) .
and even though the point number , have achieved the children of both groups , has grown in this period , has barely narrowed the difference with now 58 points .
some education supporters of the southern district last week expressed their concern that the results of school chancellor michelle example rhee and the democratic mayor adrian m. fenty was celebrated , the largest part of white pupils , who are already strong children , were driven forward .
this suggests , that we the overall judgment by the treatment of those who have raised at the top end of the scale , which is problematic and difficult , jeff smith said , a member of the board of the dc voice , a nonprofit group for the equal education in washington dc .
i will not for a range of two or three points on and , said the democratic washington city council member , kwame r. brown , the daughter of the fourth in a class of the eaton primary school has .
brown , a frequent critics of the management style of rhee figures , said , the message of the assessment point is that the funds schools of the city urgently need attention .
always of course , we would like to see the positive signs , i respect that .
what frightens me , however , is that we not spend approximately the time and energy , using the funds we for our school should .
rhee said , the district must continue , to find better ways , in order to be to meet the needs of the performance weak pupils .
in this autumn , for example , some will teachers , trained in a new read curriculum , the wilson - read - system , to use , the pupils in the upper classes of the primary school and resources aimed at school , what basic skills of reading not at the start of their school have mastered career and the significantly behind their peers class comrades .
everyday mathematics , a curriculum , from nursery school up to the sixth class games and real - life experience in the emphasis , under the former senior school inspector clifford janey according to washington and this curriculum will be some of the naep - progress , the last week have been reported , attributed .
i believe that we must continue to work , the best measures to benefit the pupils , are under the central level , rhee said .
others say that the naep highlight - results of the question , whether rhee can continue to do so , to improve the overall performance of the system and will continue to the additional money and the resources available for the performance of weak schools can , the emergency little are , in order to reduce the gap .
this is a serious dilemma for michelle rhee , bruce fuller said , a professor of education at the university of california at berkeley , results of the urban audit investigated .
is the conventional cure , and management reforms its resources on the schools , which are in the poorest areas of washington , dc .
the objective could create political aftermath , the work to this important item .
the weak point is of course , as in other urban school inspectors that they tried to keep the white and black middle class .
our focus is to ensure that we build a great schools system .
we must strengthen our schools in the city areas , so that all families , irrespective of where they live , can be sure that their children an excellent public education can receive .
janey , is the now school inspector in newark , said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements to the closure of the current gap is , the traditional public school year , in washington at the moment of 180 days is , to extend , in order to compete with the charter schools .
we must increase the school year to nearly 200 next , in order to have the power to change , janey said , with its teachers trade union last year to an agreement on 185 days per year , the he as " a milestone ' on the road to a greater increase in the next treaty .
higher training for more people than future prospect
achieved the coach the gettysburg college , with a resounding pipe .
graciela rodriguez , 12 , rising from and blinzelt a moment the sight of the white pillars , the brick fronts and of the ' emerald greens lawn . '
hardly gracielas parents have the high school in el salvador completed .
until recently had also graciela , the in silvermines spring has been recovered and now live in river allendale , never set foot on a college campuses .
its attitude and the other achtklässler of the group , the gettysburg explore , where the teaching per year 38.690 costs $ , was more reverence full visitor , than that of the enthusiastic future students .
' yes ! here , i will soon be ! ' , called graciela , who would like to study medicine , as the leader announced that they had now for natural sciences enter the building .
wow , really ? " " they said food for thought , as the low professor - to - school students ratio was reported .
the college in pennsylvania was the 7 that have visited on their three - day tour of the child and now they have the intended message fully included : the question is not whether to 's college .
the question is , where .
on the one hand , there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the united states hispanischer immigrants , what the high school not end or as a teenager pregnant are on the other hand , there are , but also hundreds of thousands , what the college , which is necessary to obtain training , in the middle class levels .
in truth , one of five of these ' second generation ' of the college hispanics americans – what is a remarkable achievement , since many of their immigrant parents , mostly from mexico came , or in central america , in the us without the high school to have concluded .
your success stories are important , researchers , because they say for a generation , the play a huge role in the work forces of the country will show , the way forward .
assess , the strong children , those who say that this very often have a natural affinity for school and a driving inherent in them to success .
many of you have also parents to set high targets , the their children and to find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with american schools .
but advice programmes also play a major role , by they graciela and millions of children as they help , to come in college , especially if these efforts on a longer time continue .
if we regarded income weak children whose parents have not the experience and skills , to help them in the search for a way through the system , then a single measure to any time will not solve the problem , said patricia gándara researcher at the university of california , davis , and the hispanic american students examined .
we must consider , for these children a supporting network of pre- school up by the high school to make available .
tour the federal programme , the gracielas college had financed , is a useful example .
it is known as implement up a gear - and is more than $ 300 million per year available for local school systems , in order to launch college - preparation programmes , the start , if incomes weak pupils in the middle school are and , until you have completed the high school continue .
in accordance with the us department for education , the programme has helped more than 10 million pupils since 1999 , 60 % of which more than in college are gone .

the us government has pushed for this type of agreement in order to build confidence between the two parties and time for negotiations to gain .

tensions between the kurds and the arab majority in the iraq are still high , in particular in relation to borders , property rights , and because the distribution of public revenues .
gates urged both sides , to reduce the potential for conflict , in order to prevent delays of the us plans , the american troops strength to reduce by 115 000 to 50 000 until the end of august .
gates also sought , the kurdish concern on the forthcoming a withdrawal of troops to dispel . to the us representatives quoted gates , masood barzani , president of the kurdish regional government , saying : ' we will be their security , prosperity and their autonomy within a united iraq .

a change of direction in the ageing china
wang weijia and her husband grew surrounded by propaganda posters , considered that the lecture you , that " mother earth is too tired , in order to maintain ' and ' a further children baby more means a grave more ' .
these lessons have you learned is that , than government officials so well in shanghai , and the by the low birth rate , and the ageing population in this summer suddenly , began to change the course and young couples ermunterten , more than to have a child , their response immediately and finally was : ' in no case ' .
we have already invested all of our time and energy in a child .
said is nothing left for a second child , wang , 31 , a staff head with a 8 - months old son .
more than 30 years after the introduction of the a - child policy in china , the two generations of notoriously dicklichen , verzogenen individual children , the affectionately be called ' small emperor ' , has produced , is in the country a population crisis .
the average birth rate is to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 , at the time fallen entered into force , this policy , the un
department for population issues , while the number of the population group of 60 years and older in the year 2020 by enjoys 16.7 % of the population to 31,1 % by the year 2050 will increase exponentially . this is far on the global average of around 20 % .
the imbalance with educated population , is in rich coastal cities like shanghai , more .
last year have 60 - year - olds and older almost 22 % of the reported residents shanghai , identified , while the birth rate under a child per couple has .
zhenhua lingli , leader of the shanghai city demographic and family planning commission has said that couples in the procreation age babies must get , in order to help ' , the relationship to reduce the ageing population shares and to alleviate the labour shortage of the future . "
shanghai will soon ' -- but not so rich -- as old as the industrial countries , such as japan and sweden , be said , ' you .
a gradual détente
enshrined in the country 's constitution in 1978 , china 's one- child policy will probably be the most controversial disposal , the of the ruling communist party until today was introduced .
couples , the breach of this policy , must reckon with huge fines -- up to its triple annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination in their work .
chinese state representatives have attributed to this policy is that the critical demands of the natural country resources could be avoided , while human rights representative abuses in the enforcement of the policy have condemned .
in rural regions have some officials pregnant women , who already has a child were forced to abortion .
many couples had also implement gender selective abortion , causing a unnatural balance of women to men .
in the past few years have government representatives for population gradually their attitude to the a - child policy weakened .
2004 , they have allowed for more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers , members of ethnic minorities and cases , in which both husband and wife individual children have been -- and 2007 was the tone many hard moderated slogans .
qiao xiaochun , a professor at the university for population research institute beijing said that government representatives recently even discussed more radical changes have , for example , couples to allow two children to , is where a partner individual child .
shanghai was in july to the first chinese city , the has launched a aggressive campaign to promote more birth .
posters , the family belehrten , only to have a child , have been replaced almost overnight of directives , which describe in detail , who for a second child question is and how we can apply for the authorisation .
has the city administration urban employees and voluntary sent for family planning , couples visit at home and information sheets under the doors to blame .
you also asked , psychological and financial advice for the available to , the more than have a child .
the response was not encouraging said , family planning representatives .
disappointing response
although from a rural town in the foreign areas officials from shanghai said , that a recovery in the amendments is of couples to see , the after the launch of the campaign want a second child , the urban districts against report no change .
in the community huinan with a population of 115 000 are still per month as an example only four to five requests a .
disappointed shanghai officials say that the expected for 2010 number of births in the city still despite the campaign in approximately 165,000 will be -- slightly higher than 2009 , but lower than in 2008 .
feng juying , leader of the family planning committee of the shanghai community caolu , said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children .
they want to give her first the best , she said .
yang jiawei , 27 , and its mrs , liu juan juan , 26 , said that they would like to have two children , and this is also legally allowed .
but they have , as many chinese , only a minor health and life insurance of government .
without a social network , they say , this decision would be irresponsible .
people in the west assess the a - child policy mistakenly as a question of human rights , yang , a civil engineer , whose mrs said in the seventh month with their first child is pregnant .
indeed , it is robbing us the opportunity to have more than a child .
but the problem is not simply in a policy .
the problem is money .
other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitate .
wang , leader of the staff , said , you would just like to a child , because it was also an individual child ' . we were the centre of the family and used that each of us has been .
we are not accustomed to us to care for others and also not really want this . '
chen zijian , a 42 -year-old , a translation companies , the said it plain .
for parents from the smes with double career , by the the birth rate is falling , he said , it is about to be successful , and for this we must be selfish .
the the today , 20 - 39 - year - olds age group , so that grew to their parents during the early days of the chinese capitalism experiment fight to see and they want to no if such a lives for themselves , he said .
also , a single child he said , is huge requirements to the time of the parents .
a mother must abandon their social life at least for two years .
then there is the area question -- " we must rebuild its housing ' -- and the planning of life -- " if the child 9 months old , it is already have a place for the best nursery schools have life course . '
most of his friends are prepared , to make this a time , chen said , but not two time .
our generation is the first , the has achieved a higher standard of living , he said .
we want to bring not too many victims .
un group devises plan to reduce emissions
the promoted by the un climate conference -- which up to now characterised by wild poznań and mutual accusations -- has on friday , publication of a document again a priority , for the next 40 years of recording an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases , and the industrial nations in the near future the greatest burden shoulders to .
the text , the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases could deliver , both the remaining obstacles manufacturers , as has also shown the way forward .
but it has been seen as an important progress in a negotiated , the time , because next week than 100 leaders from all over the world will arrive in copenhagen .
the text , the un working group established by a specially was formulated , is silent on the quantity of money from the rich countries to the poor , countries that should be so that these short and long term can meet the global warming .
he also offers a range of options for the key issues , including such as industry and large emerging countries can restrict their carbon - emitting and how high the upper limit value of the global temperature increase should be , the political decision - makers would support .
given the process will be a great flexibility , as john coequyt , a senior representatives of the sierra clubs in washington .
michael zammit cutajar , of the six page document has drafted , has summed up a negotiating text 180 pages in order to make the in the centre of what the representative of the leading climate protection of the un , ivo de boer , has described as ' the great whole " .
it shows the fundamental plans for a possible agreement , in which the industrial nations together their emissions by 25 % to 45 % by 2020 , compared with the limit values in 1990 , would reduce their emissions , while major developing countries would reduce by 15 to 30 % in the same period .
together , the countries could reduce the emissions by 50 % and 95 % by 2050 .
moreover , the european community has the talks on friday a given to boost by your assurance on the next three years to provide $ 3.6 billion per year , in order to help poorer countries , adapt to the effects of climate change - from the master of the floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation .
of the friday , nevertheless , the same verbal fire works the discussions in the last week had intended .
the american climate has special envoy todd stern began wordings rejected , the binding greenhouse gas emissions cuts to industrialised countries , compared with voluntary reductions for greater demand emerging countries , if this not be funded by the industry nations .
announced that this train the obama government a tougher line with china , as the representative of the bush government is not even two years ago .
sign the united states will not be agreement , without that greater stern , emerging countries stand up and take measures , so the also lamented the fact that the text does not go far enough , to ensure that the reductions also outside it could be confirmed .
stern its opinion was a time after the statement by the chinese vice - minister of foreign affairs he yafei , the stated that it was the leading american climate negotiators either lacks ' of common sense ' or ' it was highly irresponsible " of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the united states would help china not financially to meet the global warming .
by the fact that the future economic direction of the world 's major powers is at stake , have , both within the industrial nations , as also between the industrial nations and the fault lines emerging countries opened up .
the current fight relates also to the rescue of individual economies , as well as to the rescue of the planet , and china and the united states , which , because of their respective commitments squabbles , while poorer countries claim that the two dozen influence richest countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps .
ricardo ulate , a delegate from costa rica , said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting , who should bear the costs for the bremsung of greenhouse gas emissions , because even countries affected have begun to proceed , aggressive in making , the countries with very high greenhouse gas levy to account for their actions .
it is clear that this is a game , which will develop a new economic domination , so of ulate , also as a regional climate change advisers for conservation internationally in mexico and central america is active .
some of the countries that are most exposed to the effects of climate change , said that they would continue to fight on a legally binding treaty in copenhagen , although the leading participants to say that the discussions in the best case will lead to a political agreement .
has the alliance of small island states with 43 members early on friday morning a 24 - page draft treaty presented .
artur until - butcher , the leading the international climate negotiations for the european commission , said that the offensive of small island states ' political pressure on the whole political process , " in part , because they are now united and measures of the emerging countries , such as china , india , and demand .
the talks , got a new urgency , as the delegates have focused on the fact that , most of the open questions still to the arrival of the government leaders to be resolved , in order to come to an agreement .
high - level representatives , as the indian environment minister , jairam ramesh , and the chinese vice - minister entstiegen their aircraft and around by the corridors of bella centre to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to claims posts , which will be negotiated during the next week .
13,000 people -- the pure extent of the assembly , daily in congress centre and from activists , gitarre match organise night shows , in which they laugh is on the countries , and sell , and betrayed their view , the draft treaty will be passed on hand to hand rather than by e-mail -- is already a challenge .
building the intensity just on that almost all the important ministers are here , and from wednesday 60 government leaders will be in copenhagen .
we shall now proceed to the oberliga , carlos manuel rodriguez , vice - president said for global policy of organisation conservation internationally .
come the heavyweights .
britain 's first 225 km / h faster train defines the monday feeling new
monday morning at 5 o'clock 13 will be a pipe penetrate the darkness , in order to announce a train departure , which is a revolution in transport in the united kingdom .
the first high - speed commuter train in the country is in its lightning journey of ashfort , kent , after the london st pancras 225 km / h achieve and 93 km in 38 minutes .
to lord adonis , the transport ministers , will then lady kelly holmes on board of the first javelin - commuter services from london .
he hopes , that the new service united kingdom , finally to an international rail network quicker , more reliable trains will ankoppeln and the large urban areas and the midlands , of the north of scotland in london will bind .
the neglected province to living commuter cities could be reduced , labour meps hours would radically and the exchange of aircraft and car to the rail would reduce national emissions of carbon and the congestion on the streets .
believe the three large parties in theory this vision .
but the british pound , the many billion are necessary for the construction of a new national rail network , the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage in the british high - speed of tracks could still applying the brakes .
high speed two ( hs2 ) , a companies based in january , the government is to present a viability study , will lord adonis according to the times deliver the report on 30 december .
this would give it a detailed routes card of the next stage of the high - speed rail network .
the new railway line , the london with is to link the west midlands , with a margin of five metres will pass to urban areas and in places , where the impact on the environment are controversial .
in the free terrain , the plan will the concept within a gap of 25 metres from the final route .
hs2 should also three options for a greater , northwards leading produce high - speed rail network .
lord adonis will respond in the spring .
preferred option proposed is a y - shaped the routing , in which a single high - speed link would lead in the west midlands .
the route would are in , or in the vicinity of birmingham parts and a abzweig would lead western pennines to manchester and scotland and another in the direction of north - east after sheffield , leeds and newcastle - upon tyne .
a single line would lead to scotland .
" it appears to be the most effective option , " a rail insider said .
after the completion , the travel time would reduce between london and edinburgh to 2 hours 40 minutes .
the first part of the route which would not be opened in 2025 , would allow the travellers , the london - birmingham route in 49 minutes today , compared with just over a time , to go .
the draft offer the trains , with a speed of the possibility to travel 400 km / h , which the british rail network the fastest europe would .
the first line has been so planned that 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1.100 people can travel point .
up to 18 trains per hour on the london - route birmingham could be in operation .
again , this would mean that in london a terminus station would be necessary , on the 20,000 travellers per hour - could be .
given the spatial restrictions in the capital is expected that a existing station would be extended to the high - speed network .
rail experts say that only st pancras internationally or euston have this potential .
lord adonis will be aware , whether or not this plan its opinion should be continued , but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken only after the parliament elections .
but if he is the wheels in motion , that in sections of the network must be built .
trains should first of the high - speed lines on existing rail routes in the north of birmingham change , which the travel time between london and scotland would continue to lie in over three hours .
this is a crucial sticking point , so that a shift from air to rail can be sure , a beacon for the rail revolution .

from nanterre by the court of justice has decided on friday , the artists françois - marie banier to assess , in order to ascertain whether he , as the daughter of milliardärin liliane beds court claims , has a weak moment of the 80 -year-old exploited , in order to be a part of their assets ' being cheated .

this decision means that , in fact , there will be a process in this case , the saga , one of the richest families of france is worthy , in the mother and daughter scrap and at the same time the reins of the cosmetics empire in the hand to l'oréal have .
but also the 15 criminal court ordered a medical examination of 87 - -year-old liliane beds court , which will be performed jointly by three doctors .
the heir and main shareholder of l'oréal has so far refused to undergo such a study , especially not in the , during the investigation of the state prosecutor of nanterre presented conditions .
appointed the on friday doctors should produce a report before the 10 march 2010 , in which they give clear known as to whether and to what times liliane beds court in a state of weakness can have considered .
i think that it will be subject to these investigations .
i will talk with it , the lawyer said by mrs beds court , me georges kiejman , after the negotiating .
what the lawyer of françoise beds court - meyers , me olivier metzner is concerned , it is very satisfied with the decision of the court of justice .
this is an excellent piece of news ( ... ) . the opinion will prove that he ( banier ) has this old lady manipulated , the must be protected , confirmed it .
since two years ago , the only daughter of liliane beds court a criminal legal action against françois - marie banier , photographer and all - round artists , and accused him to have exploited the weakness of your mother , years , in order to grants of a total of a billion euro in the form of bank check , insurance policies or paintings ' being cheated .

managers - revolution or the end of the strategic early information ?
if nothing changes in the governance of the large french companies has our fight for the development of the economic intelligence ... in vain
for over a decade ago , the attitude of the management of large companies in terms of its staff , the position of the said companies vis-à-vis the consumer before the marketing revolution : it is the best intended for the personnel join ' values ' , as it was on the consumer - products of the technicians in the work designed to impose .
by the customers in the heart of the company has the marketing - revolution the strategies of the conquest of the markets in the place ... despite the authoritarian temptation products separately factors preferences of the clients to impose regularly again !
demobilisation of the staff can lead to a lethal demoralisation .
the suicides in france telecom , psa or renault are only the tip of a much wider phenomenon , which , in particular , the employees affected .
these demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company from , in particular those of r & eund , what is even more crucial , to those of the economic intelligence .
in fact calls for the iu ( intelligence economique = economic intelligence ) ' of all the parties involved ( ... ) a pro- active approach ' ; it claims and a future - oriented view of the staff a use , the totally contradict the instructions of the authoritarian management .
this is why we are calling for a occupational revolution , which would involve , the staff in denmittel point of the concerns of the company equal to the customers .
use the very - related internal opinion polls
are the internal opinion polls , as the questionnaire , the orange has presented its wage earners , this revolution in regard to the management - practice suggest ?
unfortunately , i fear not .
- firstly , because i was able to establish that the entire structure with a new situation in the end after many roundabout way priority concerned , to do this , ... what it always has done .
also because the authoritarianism , a proportional to the importance of the pathology of power - its own failure increases .
and finally , because most leaders have a simplistic idea by the human behavior .
emerged from the large engineering schools is your interpretation of the psychology mechanistic .
they take by intellectuals comfort the old behaviori tables theory , the recently by the us - american " neuroscience ' reactivated and unwittingly far - reaching of scientific and research institutes and has been spread by the media .
thus and by you suggested that it is possible , the ' lever " ( sic ) to the commitment of employees to work , encouraged a survey published aktuellein le figaro.fr of ipsos the leadership forces in a position to a mechanistic management system , which is not suitable for today 's world .
measure the mobilisation factors identify and
instead , requires a for the smooth functioning of the modern business necessary occupational revolution the adoption of a final view of human behavior .
it is , in any consideration to integrate or practice of management a fundamental minutes : for the wage - earners is the commitment for the company only possible if it clearly seems as a means to a part of their dreams , their ambition to implement and their projects .
moment , take only the studies from the multi- functional analysis , this conception of the motivation of the staff .
these studies have shown that they set their businesses at the basis of a doxa , the judge you by their perceived picture of the company allowed to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals .
thanks to the mobilisation of identification and of the measurement of these factors , the leadership of the companies can predict their " social " control , and pre- empt and their human resource management back to the rights centre place .
so they create a fertile ground , for the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence is favourable .

to michael gerson , former recorder from george w. bush , and now editor in the washington post , obama has " a very american " speech .
in addition , that he presents itself as the ' kosmopolit ' , such as ' he always power , " he has spoken ' as an american president ' , as he pointed out that the europeans ' as in a security bubble , the they have not created themselves and for their protection not do a lot , " gerson .
among the few , not staunch called rights of the former un ambassador john bolton , a hawk the bush - era , the speech at the website of the national review online as " boring , highfalutin and inspiration happening " .
on the left of the president shows the democratic representatives dennis kucinich concerned , as barack obama defended the resort to the armed forces .
packaged we the war under the guise of justice , the massacre of the innocent quite simply , justify he warns .
praised the press the moderate left , however , remains on the side of the president .
the los angeles times , which is still believe that the nobel peace prize was premature awarded to obama , called the address itself for a speaker like him , known for his talent is , as ' monumental work ' .
the speech in oslo ' provides a timetable plan to the management of international decisions against the conflicts and the poverty and the repression ' , so the california newspaper enthusiastic .
the new york times is of the opinion that obama " the necessary discourse proclaimed " and called his speech ' bleak and exemplary at the same time ' .

furthermore , the judges the lifting of parliamentary immunity , announced the türk and tugluk enjoy , as well as the seizure of goods of the party .
the dtp in parliament ( now has 21 seats of 550 ) .
leading expressed before the verdict of the party to the effect that the parliamentarians parliament would rather leave , as such as party unemployed to meet parliamentarians .
followed a the decision in the year 2007 by the prosecutor of the turkish federal court procedure initiated abdurrahman yalçinkaya . he accused the dtp , the " instructions " to follow the kurdistan workers ' party ( pkk ) , the ankara and many other countries is seen as a terrorist organisation .
many observers believe that the dtp the legal political display window of the pkk is rebels .
assured the party , " to have no link ' the pkk , but refuses to call this as a terrorist organisation and calls to negotiations on the government .
computer the government between the verdict of the constitutional court , which is seeking to respond to the kurdish community and a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the kurds to propose , by the kurds to the support of the pkk everything dry up and to end the conflict .

since the announcement of the court of thousands of demonstrators gathered before the premises of the dtp , in the million city of diyarbakir in the south - east , which has largely populated by kurds .
the order forces firing tear - gas grenades and water cannons a , as the demonstrators began , molotov cocktails and throwing stones to .
hundreds of people also demonstrated in istanbul .
türk after the verdict , assumed that the decision of the court ' will continue to deepen the despair ' .
' turkey can this ( kurdish , anm. that editorial ) question not on the basis of the ban a party clarify , " he told of the press .
the government , consisting of a party , which has emerged from the islamist movement , regretted the decision also .

collapse of the snow can come
a properly knackigen winter , it is , what is brewing burger wolfgang wishes .
not because he would like to bully the citizen , says the winter head the fes .
but , so that its staff the whole of the vehicle try and master technology can learn .
at the weekend might be so far for the first time it according to meteorology .
330 staff and more than 120 vehicles stand ready , in order to deal with snow and ice .
this is the fes after a precise plan .
snow as soon as it board in frankfurt and the sub - zero temperatures , be travelled 20 faithful to the so-called a - routes with large vehicles , explained brewing burger .
this includes , for example , main transport and transit roads as the new way and the hanauer country road .
approaches , public local passenger transport routes , pedestrians but also fire zones and routes with gap , such as the atzelberg road .
at three o'clock in the service of the fes begins morning
the around 1040 kilometres , in needs in a maximum of three hours with responsible salt , the better that wetlands be spread more .
therefore the fes starts at three p.m. at night of , ' so that the routes are free , until the professional launching transport ' .
difficult it will , if it only at 7.30 snowing .
then we have a problem , the winter head says , " because no one then , the distribution of vehicles is prepared to make room ' .
only then , so it not further snowing , are feeder - and development of road , including the council - beil - road , in the number .
have the final priority sides - and in addition to roads .
brewing burger where it will be complaints , know .
at five o'clock in the morning is the odds in order to the fes foot soldiers of the way , risks points and crossings priority are removed .
concern to all the cycle paths fes often could not .
there is in frankfurt , a special services of 22 until 4.30 a.m. p.m. above all the brewing burger bridges in mind , says .
because there are to these fast glätte , is , as soon as the temperature falls under two degrees , the streuer .
this will also called by the police if need be .
the cradle of dinosaurs
tawa hallae saw from as many other carnivorous dinosaurs : the two metres long and 1.50 metres major animal expired on two strong behind legs , had a whole skull with sharp , gebogenen teeth , short poor with sickle claws and a long tail .
lived would have the kind of a few million years later , it would be nothing special .
but tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs , with this body characteristics , reports sterling nesbitt of the university of texas in austin and colleagues in the magazine science the thursday .
about 215 million years ago , the animal lived in today 's new mexico , the then in a dry area of super - continent pangäa was the equator .
tawa opened a new window on the early evolution of dinosaurs , nesbitt says .
it shows us a lot about the relationships , the spread and the features of the early dinosaurs .
2006 , nesbitt and other paleontologist started with a excavation on the ghost in the north ranch new mexicos .
we have sometimes found a dozen dinosaurs in a day - bones , which is unprecedented for deposits from the day , reported team - member randall irmis by the utah museum of natural history .
some of the bone identified the researchers quickly as new .
in the course of the archaeological they played the remains of a total of five individuals .
fund confirmed theories on dino - early history
the name ' tawa ' comes from the hopi sun god - indians .
nesbitt for sterling it is an exceptional fund : ' dinosaurs fossils - from the day we are extremely rare , is usually only individual fragments . '
other dinosaurs - not necessarily experts share the enthusiasm .
particularly spectacular , this fund is not , but it confirmed some theories on the early history of the dinosaurs , says about martin sander , of the university of bonn .
after the current doctrine , the dinosaurs for the first time around 230 million years ago .
many of the oldest fossils are but incomplete , why the allocation this ur - dinos is most controversial .
so , for example , the experts debating when the echsen aufspalteten in their three main lines of development : the carnivorous theropoden , to which later the tyrannosaurus committee , the velociraptor and also the birds , known as the ensure ' " long with vierbeinigen sauropoden and their relatives , and the plant - eating ornithischia ( bird basin saurier ) , which , for example the species triceratops and stegosaurus were .
nesbitt and after the analysis of his colleagues is tawa hallae a original theropode .
he is an interesting combination of primitive and progressive characteristics on , nesbitt says .
on the skull of tawa hallae found the references to luftsäcke researchers , for example , as you also have the descendants of theropoden , the birds , .
thanks to the luftsäcke is the breathing of birds more effective than the mammals .
in tawa hallae were also the bones of the vertebral column seems partly with air filled .
tawa is the oldest and most savage theropode with air bags , randall irmis says .
because the line of relatives of the enormous sauropoden later also luftsäcke and lightweight construction - bones , probably already was the common brought this useful innovation vorfahre of both groups .
at least three waves of migration after north america
dinosaur in south america because the most primitive have known so far lived , conclude the researchers that the echsen there appeared for the first time .
separated therefore the three lines of development and spread of south america early on all continents from , which were still a super - continent pangäa formed a only country mass .
speaking for the fact that , together with the team tawa hallae the remains of two further , not particularly closely related theropoden was .
can the three not of a common ancestor , immigrants , the researchers argue .
we believe that there were at least three waves of migration after north america , says alan turner by the american museum of natural history in new york , a co- author of the science study .
however , there are also contradictions .
an even older way to a sister silesaurus , the group of dinosaurs heard , lived in poland , the bonn paläontologe martin says sander today .
its opinion could a distorted picture , because in south america simply particularly many primitive dino - fossils are maintained , while , on other continents to find little is .
as it created the dinosaurs , from a relatively rare sides to the line of the reptiles stock dominant country vertebrate animals of the earth middle ages to develop , is still puzzling .
during the day the dinosaurs their area still living with many other reptiles , for example with the ancestors of today 's crocodiles and the flugsaurier and with many other echsen .
at the end of the day the dinosaurs spread to all the world and developed many new species , while the kinship on the border of the day to the law ausstarb .
success story was not going to last forever
there are two hypotheses , in order to explain this change , says martin sander .
it could have given to die a mass , the dinosaurs happen to be survived , but the other reptiles not .
or the dinosaurs were better adapted , so that they could beat the competition from the field .
the success story was certainly not going to last forever .
150 million years later gave a meteorite impact of a group of animals to flourish , which is also already in the triassic entwickeltet had and since then a shadow general fristete : the mammals .

new silicon - valley
long years it was as secret city , for western visitors inaccessible .
selenograd , one of the capital moscow ten districts , in the soviet union was a tough location for secret defence research .
today , the community with their 216 000 inhabitants , 37 kilometres from the moscow centre , as a " russian silicon valley ' .
significant research and production centres for micro - and nanoelectronics are .
already since september 2008 , representatives had selenograds contacts to frankfurt science location riedberg linked - with the uni institutes and the firms of frankfurt innovation centre ( fiz ) .
there have been several mutual visits and on wednesday now signed selenograd and riedberg in frankfurt a ' protocol on closer cooperation ' .

but it is also about economic relations .
firms of the fiz will be possible , to gain a foothold in the growing russian market .
conversely , want to russian science firms contracts in germany acquire .
selenograd is the seat important russian research institutes and companies .
for example , these include the moscow institute for electron technology , the big companies sitronics and rosssijskaja elektronika .
in 1958 , the community was a so-called ' socialist plan city ' has been created for the defence research .
selenograd ( literally translated ' green city ' ) received his name of the forested hill landscape , are embedded in the research facilities .
stuttgart brake
the dimension of stuttgart 21 is not set high enough .
for the supporters of the project it is simply and simply in order to ' the new heart of europe ' .
rightly so . s21 is much more than the deeper lay a station , more than a monströses construction project , the city of baden - württemberg country capital for a decade will be in disarray building sites chaos .
stuttgart 21 arose from the spirit of the 1980 's .
capita stations with tracks , in the middle of the city , at that time were hailed as the end of the nineteenth century , the transport technical fossils as constraints of a modern rail transport , a lot of time , as it once needed , locomotives from behind forward umzuspannen .
entering , very briefly , to travel - so ´ s go further .
and that is why the head should stations disappear : in frankfurt and munich .
and in stuttgart : a station , for the sake of such as of passage route of the trans - european rail magistrale between paris / bratislava and budapest is - that is why the slogan ' the heart of europe ' .
s21 will now actually addressed , although the visions of the 1980s not longer are compatible with the reality .
itself very ambitious planners have recognised that it is almost unaffordable in the hessischen and the bavarian city , the deeper implement .
capita stations do , however , also have no longer a and exit problem , since modern turning trains with driving vehicles and tax dare at both ends .
nevertheless , stuttgart 21 along with the ice - new route after ulm section now will not addressed .
country - and local politicians have pushed it through .
power with the railways , also because the risks of the individual biggest infrastructure project of the republic of the taxpayers and not the state corporation contributes .
cities terms , the projects can be reasonably justify .
there is new city areas , which - believes we tables illustrating the planners generated the computer - will be equipped with much green .
rail is s21 harmful for the transport system .
development are the gateway station and the lines intended for the movement of persons , the we - typical 1980s - huge growth attributed .
at that time , there were not the competition of the low - cost carriers .
modern transport policy must go but it first of all , therefore , to strengthen the freight transport , as the transport on the rail is very much more environment - friendly than by lorry on the road .
but the new route because intense climbs is not fit to freight trains .
much serious is that s21 indirectly affected also many other rail projects .
good eur six billion in schwäbischen verbuddelt be .
this is the official number .
experts 10 to 15 billion for realistic .
observation is , in the next decade will the money to other hubs and closely in the network lack .
as a whole sixty greater projects are on the list of the ministry of transport .
one of the most important is the development of the good 180 kilometres long route through the rhine valley .
since 1987 will attend the route in the slow built .
urgently necessary , would be to push to the tube correctly here .
but s21 will act as a brake .
bottles of the rhine valley route will the neck for the international freight transport : in the middle of the heart of europe .
government is examining verdict on the airport
the country in the wiesbadener provincial government has left open , whether they against the judgment of the hessischen administrative court of justice ( vgh ) will go to the ban on night flights in revision .
the cdu / fdp coalition have asked experts to the more than 400 pages vgh - judgment legally to let , economy minister said , dieter posch ( fdp ) .
the vgh in kassel had on this next justified in writing , that the country in the case of the construction of the north - west runway planned in the new rules to frankfurt airport the ban on night flights .
the authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m. , as it is the country government , not with the legal protection of the population against noise at night offered to reconcile .
the coalition must decide until 4 january , whether it is against the judgment in revision .
criticised the opposition to this postponement and urge the representatives of the government , on a revision in the federal administrative court in leipzig to give up .
spd torsten schäfer group chairman - gümbel called on the cdu and the fdp , to their before the election promise made to return to a ban on night flights . otherwise it is as ' breach " to values .
it is difficult , if word must be condemned , greens said - head tarek al-wazir in reference to the german free democratic party ( fdp ) election slogan " we believe that word ' .
minister posch rejected the accusation by schäfer - gümbel , the country government attempts , with ' right verdreherei and sleight of hand " but still to come to their night flights .
a precise legal examination need their time .
the coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a " rapid first impression ' .
we need a legal , safe entscheiung stefan müller ( fdp ) said .
so , as you is the opposition , are the statements of its group , on the ban on night flights never have been .

rapid election
it was then but everything much faster than expected .
barely two weeks after the zdf board the president - in- office of the editor of santa claus brender from the office had urged , the station can present a successor .
yesterday evening wanted to vote on the personalie the body .
favourite was as peter frey , director of the zdf - capital studios in berlin .
it was a confirmation of the station , however , not - officially in order to anticipate the procedure not .
however , have also played a role , the zdf - controller markus schächter not to damage further , this proposal should also do not get through to the management board .
frey , schächters candidate , needs the support of nine of the members of the 14 body .
the result of the vote was not yet in print this edition .
two weeks ago , was schächter with its proposal , the treaty with nicholas brender failed to extend for a further five years , on the administrative board .
only seven members languages for brender from , seven voted against him . brenders dismissal was a heavy defeat for schächter , but a erwartbare .
majority in the management board because the union had already signalled weeks before the election , brender not in office confirm to want to .
had the organised resistance against the editor of the hessische prime minister roland koch .
with the argument , under brender have news broadcasts of the zdf lost ratings , he rejected a further term of the highly respected journalist chief .
until shortly before the elections , it therefore protests , in which the political influence on the zdf was castigated .
least had even 35 state rights interfered in the debate , such as chefs those deemed unconstitutional 's action .
nothing came of it .
to the person
peter frey was born on 4 august in bingen in 1957 .
he studied policy , education and romanistik .
then he worked in the south - west radio and the frankfurter rundschau .
frey switched on zdf in 1983 , firstly on the ' today - journal ' .
subsequent stations : in 1988 to 1990 personal spoke of the journalist head ; in 1991 / 92 the correspondent in washington ; until 1998 head and moderator of the ' tomorrow magazine " ; until 2001 head the zdf - foreign policy ; since then director of the zdf - capital studios .
dismiss the greens , after the announced brenders , on wednesday , nor by the industries leaf medium magazine the journalists of the year was elected , a constitution complaint .
koch 's adversary in the management board , the rhineland - pfälzische prime minister kurt beck , stated in the last week , the countries should change the zdf - state treaty , so that staff proposals of the controller not can be blocked by a politically motivated majority .
an extract of party leaders from the supervisory bodies of the zdf castle , however , also beck from .
brenders heir - apparent peter frey had recommended the management board with a wise move , by he dismiss the body immediately after the brender - strongly criticised for that .
thanks to this belegs journalistic independence was both schächter it without loss of face for the post of head journalist nominate as also the management board choose , without come in the suspicion , a partisans do more to try to coax into office .
arithmetic will in the party frey already imputed to the liberal left - wing .
study will entrümpelt
part success for the students : after a year , the culture ministers of the countries of the education strike on thursday at last a : at a meeting of culture ministers - and university rectors ' conference , both sides agreed to the study to want to improve conditions in bachelor and master .
the students should be in the situation in the future , their studies also able to deal with .
in the individual agreed to reduce it to , the examination burdens are principle : will every study module only conclude with a single audit .
also to review the workload of the students will be guaranteed ' and ' a realistic and reasonable level .
policy and universities also want to the recognition of audit services between the universities within and outside germany simplify .
the countries committed themselves to targets for undergraduate and masters courses , common structure more flexible .
deviating countries rules in addition , it should not be .
less tests
since the beginning of the students protests in june bear rectors culture ministers and uni - the common dictum of better studierbarkeit in their mouths .
now it has been filled for the first time , with a specific content .
council decided the so-called accreditation , drastically to reduce the number of audits in part : ' every module closing in the rule with only a test , " it is said in a 30 - sides paper , that the authorisation of courses of study partly to new rules .
burden with the ' significant reduction of the test , " the accreditation council declared - chairman reinhold grimm 's fairy tale , should be a stop to ' failure of development , the the studierbarkeit significantly disrupted . '
also to ' studierbarkeit ' in future ' be the decisive criterion ' in shaping .
modules as content to examine are ' strict ' whether ' unnecessary einengungen the students in the election of the
events would prevent ' .
the students , ' would be entitled to receive , margins , allow the own initiative , and promote ' .
should apply the rules in the authorisation of new , but also in the existing review courses .
this must all be five years of " reakkreditiert " – what it means that takes until 2015 , however , have been reviewed until all the courses of study .
responsibility for are national ten accreditation agencies , under the accreditation council established by the countries .
the culture ministers have had the countries in october ' with emphasis ' called on to influence the agencies , so that the material abundance of not too big and the testing regime is not to strictly .
in individual federal countries have universities and colleges of with the country ministries already agreed on the appropriate measures .
than have been one single country said so far rhineland - palatinate for the further development of the bologna process additional resources .
of the money is to establish the universities especially tutoren programmes and study advice as well as offices strengthen review and abroad .
country and spend universities want to make eur 10 million .
in early 2010 , the government wants to table an amendment of the higher law to parliament .
after this for the conclusion of a study should be a single audit model only still needed .
shaping the study will be more flexible , also seeks to ensure the recognition of prove to other universities and facilitate the access to the master .
by the end of next year everything should be reviewed courses of the country on their studierbarkeit .
government and opposition , on thursday had once again on the study conditions in the country argued .
alongside praise , but it also criticise the decisions .
the federal bureau of the juso - higher groups called for the shaping of education policy , in future , not more ' behind closed doors ' the minister and university rectors take place .
at the latest , after the education strikes should now also the students ' affected have a say ' .
received support the future academics by the president of the university rectors ' conference ( hrk ) , margret winter umbrella : ' we need the experience of the students , " they said on thursday , at a meeting with the ministers of culture with which the hrk on a common reform paper was discussed .
have the education and science ( branches of the trade unions ) the bonn decisions as a whole does not go far enough : they calls for a legal entitlement , of any graduates with an undergraduate degree the access to a further masters course allows .
on the other hand , the countries must ensure that sufficient for the current generation of undergraduate students tomorrow masters study jobs with best possible study conditions available , so forces board member andreas cellar .
stop the countries need to clear more lecturers .
to a freer access to the masters , but not the culture ministers .
more than a footnote to herta müller
respond in germany and from is beautiful ' almost no control ... is the first line of a poem of the lyrikers werner söllner , in the this in troubling language scrap the arrival of experience of a dissidents addressed , the freedom of the won , but , at the same time , has lost his language area .
werner born of the 1951 in the romanian banat söllner had first as a german and english - teachers in bucharest and , later , editor worked in a kinderbuch publishing , before he 1982 to frankfurt am main relocated .
söllner has been awarded with various literature prices , in 1993 he thought the legendary frankfurter poetik lectures at the goethe university , and since 2002 , it is director of the forum for hessischen literature in the mousonturm in frankfurt .
literary for considerable attention , he last tuesday during a meeting in munich , in the it " german literature in romania in the mirror and distorting mirror their securitate acts ' .
confused and embarrassed söllner read out a clear statement , in the german writer he before romania colleagues , including richard wagner , william totok , franz hodjak , and helmuth women dorfer , his cooperation than in the for the romanian secret service securitate admitted .
together with some of the present had söllner 1989 the german language price received .
recruitment of trials have gradually begun , first 1971 .
so i am , söllner closed , ' someone who has campaigned against the securitate intimidation attempts not enough . '
the lyricist werner söllner is in the walter .
almost at the same time with the nobel peace prize tribute for herta müller and whose unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms dictatorial rule will the literature scene and in particular the community of german originating from romania authors shaken by a case , the plumb the depths and identify the despicable of a political system , which is based on monitoring , and domestic spying .
werner söllner is , so far we after bisherigem knowledge can say , not only , but also the perpetrators victims .
acts of in its securitate have played a role in the walter , said after the confession söllners of literature scientists michael markel and referred to the positive influence of in the walter for him .
he had it in all at the time for him , " markel swindled out sensitive points ' .
it is a moral need him , this comment to make .
söllners statement was in the form and before this audience unexpectedly , completely surprising is the commitment of a former dissident and its cooperation with the romanian secret services , however , not .
germany is a cosy reserve for securitate - have been informer , herta müller have already had in july , written in the time after it had read its own acts , ; 914 sides , .
the people concerned , it must be suspect , be speculation and probably also in some case have known , what is behind the clear name aliases sorin , voicu and also walter lay .
unlike in the here now very procedure safe screening in the stasi acts is dealing with the legacy of the securitate - monitoring still very diffuse .
thwarted a systematic information is in the past few years and has been hampered .
a the birthler - authority appropriate national council to review the securitate - acts ( cnsas ) was established until 1999 , the launch of acts since then , however , has been rather slow .
only since 2005 , there is a law governing the management of the acts .
that the influence of former securitate - members in romania is still very large , documented after the announcement of the nobel peace prize for herta müller an interview , in which a former head of securitate - from temesvar dismissive about the prize winner .
they have a psychosis , finally , they have only once interrogated .
the scandal of power said is quite openly in the shape of the freedom of expression here to express can .
certainly söllner include the case , as so often in connection with reticent to blame , inevitable issues .
why only now ? whom was harmed ? the measured response to listening to the söllners commitment gives hope that the continuation of this chapter of knowledge drive rather than guilt and shame will be determined .
to genese the plant from herta müller , who yesterday has received the nobel peace prize , it is more than a footnote .

dream worlds
some people see in wachem state images and hear vote , does not see or hear the other .
not only in mental health and in the drugs binge blurring of the borders between fantasy and reality .
as long as it happens in the sleep , everything is in order .
if we are in our dark rooms with our eyes closed , we must give us the wildest ideas and imagination entities out unchecked .
however , those who , in the wachsein dream - like conditions experienced , sees things and listens , does not see or hear the other , applies in the modern western world most drug addiction as crazy or , at least as a crank .
but images and vote of this kind arise not only on mental health or in narcotic drugs .
blame our imagination : the same neural processes that enable us to draw up homes to write to paint or images novels , sometimes have to ensure that the borders between the dream , delusion and reality are becoming increasingly blurred .
dream exponentially modified awake awareness conditions in the different forms can occur in the best case , we call them visions , in the worst case madness .
even if the trigger and effect distinguish may , the visions of mystikerin hildegard of bingen , the drugs experiences of new - age - prophet carlos castaneda , schamanische entrückung conditions , psychoses and hallucinations but lead similar processes .
hallucinations or delusions arise if the balance of neural offered substances of the brain - all the progress dopamin , serotonin and noradrenaline , acetylcholin - off the rails and the interaction of various brain share is disturbed .
complex hallucinations and wahnhafte idea are very often during a schizophrenic psychosis .
more about him has no power , the difficult
the context of delusion and dream has philosophers and medical professionals since antiquity .
aristotle concept hallucinations as a form of dream in the state , wilhelm griesinger , one of the founder of modern psychiatry , noted 1861 a " great similarity of the mistaken one with dream conditions ' , the dream of sigmund freud was even ' a psychosis , with all the inconsistencies , wahnbildungen , deceit of such a " sense .
it is autumn 2001 , when henning t. transformed into a comic strip figure .
body is two dimensions and be quietschbunt .
more about him has no power , the difficult , it hangs in the room ceiling .
enters it senses a .
produce vicious make behind him , with blood red , distorted fratzen , teeth fletschend .
they hunting it , throw him with serious , inflammatory boots , it against the walls , it feels the pain in the whole body .
noisy , malicious vote roar from walls and radio .
it can no longer bear it , the votes , the upbraid and offend him .
henning t. is tearing two cable out of the stereo , knotet you to a noose and brace of a crux of the ceiling .
it is rising on a loud speaker and is tightening the noose around the neck .
jumps .
solves the noose .
shouting the you should be a lesson , the vote in trommelfell zerfetzendem choir , ' go in the clinic , and let you cure ' .
henning t. is 40 years old , it has today six acute psychoses seen back , the last is 2 years , the first almost 20 years .
it was triggered by lsd .
his diagnosis is schizo affective - paranoid psychosis , it is also , it takes depressed bi - medicines , against the depression , the mania , the schizophrenia .
he has learned , to live with his disease , for three years is he married .
in the psychosis , i have seen worst fear and deepest despair he says .
bore the images are cruel reality
about a % of the population ill , at least once in the life of schizophrenia in psychiatric clinics they will be treated as second most common illness after the depression .
affected in an acute schizophrenic psychosis can usually not distinguish more between domestic and foreign world , they get trapped in a state of on heated to hallucinations , sizes - relationships or persecution mania can lead to .
hear is the vote - particularly widespread vote , the orders , comment on or dialogisieren .
also optical hallucinations are not infrequently .
can the affected important not to separate , the brain more of trivial not more cost of purging , the system can disturbing signals awareness is being inundated with impressions .
as the dream opens the psychosis the floodgates for a spate of ideas and fantasies , the deeper awareness classes bracket .
centered the reality perception in the psychosis is entity , says professor thomas fox , oberarzt the clinic for general psychiatry in the university klinikum heidelberg .
the schizophrenic is in the centre of the loop , everything has an importance to him .
at the same time , it is in a passive role , it will , in a similar dream , of the events overwhelmed and can you not actively shape .
schizophrenic therefore often feel threatened , controlled and manipulated .
matching is a reality you usually not possible , the contributed images are excluded cruel reality , wake up .
once in their lives to have seen a hallucinatory
unlike in the dream , fox says , " remains but the sensory and geographical structure of reality , the received the perceived psychosis , in principle . "
idea of the obsession and hallucinations based in reality , the verfremdung of erlebens will take place in the real framework .
exactly why our brain vagaries , , researchers is still proposing puzzle .
exception in each human conditions can lead that he loses the reality short- lived , fox says .
but not everyone will develop a psychosis .
it seem to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia , but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the determinants alone .
researchers assume that in affected minimal brain damage .
we suspect that the brain maturing of the brain in an early stage of development will be disrupted , by a virus disease of the mother during pregnancy , for example , explained fox .
but there remain a puzzle , as the disruption of the neural system is reached , is also the first is not manifestiere for many years .
environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger for a psychosis be , if there is the negotiable .
halluzinogene drugs can also trigger psychoses , because they interfere in the transmitter system .
if our brain is overheating
is the stupidity , psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medicines , to get rid of it , other give money for drugs from , in order to get what , says the lübecker psychology professor erich caste .
whether contributed images are seen as a pleasant or unpleasant , is often only a question of the position .
caste collects for ten years ago , reports on hallucinations and fallacy phenomena , in the last year he has its results in the book " the unreal world in our head ' evaluated .
hallucinations are among the typical accompanying phenomena of psychoses , but also of surprisingly many other diseases .
these include mental disorders , such as borderline or depression often also , diseases such as migraines , too , epilepsy , multiple sclerosis or alzheimer 's and skull brain traumas .
surprisingly , hallucinations under certain conditions even the brain healthy people .
hallucinations , so caste , from memory content , which normally be held back .
areas they arise , if , in which will be processed sensory , überaktiv are blocked or too little ; if our is lacking in brain is overheating , or also , if stimulation .
drugs can trigger this state as such as brain damage or psychosis .
barrenness , but also withdrawal , stress , love distress or other mental exception conditions .
recent studies were up to a third of those polled said that at least once in their lives to have seen a hallucinatory .
in the summer of 2005 , sarah k. 16 years old , they live in a small town in mecklenburg - west pomerania and visited secondary school there .
a very normal girls , actually .
if there would not be the pictures and the vote .
in the break it can happen that a schlaksiger young with long , dark hair it addresses .
if it responds to the peers look at it surprised - nobody else does this see or hear young .
you believe that the timid girls for a versponnene day träumerin , but sarah k. not dreaming , it knows it .
awake , you can see and hear it is these young , just as they alongside them can see and hear the girls in the bank .
they can feel his presence even , at least for moments .
a pleasant this feeling is that they may the young .
am i crazy ? , , you sometimes wonder .
but you know that this young and the other contributed images is not are real and disappear again .
night , the phenomena are often frightening
often are the fallacy images also a burden .
if you in the area of the class , it can the teaching substance is sometimes not consequences , because of teachers in their eyes and ears just presenting a new peers , while for all other hearing - and visible on the table mathematical equations explained .
night , the phenomena are often frightening .
if you in their dark room on sleep waiting , and the much too rarely comes much too late , they can often not distinguish , whether you awake is or already dreams , whether the images which it sees the fratzen adversely affected or the girls with the average wounds of poor and legs , before their open or eyes closed .
let me is crying out in a calm , they to shape the .
tells you nothing that the parents and friends believe they would be crazy .
autumn 2009 . sarah k. is 20 years old today .
it has in the last year the insisted baccalaureate and live together with your friend .
before a year , the hallucinations have stopped .
since you on the internet contact with the psychologists caste has included , they know that it is not crazy .
mania is also a work of art despair
if someone is socially isolated or under stimulus withdrawal suffers , it has with great likely hallucinations , says caste after a while .
i suspect , then the brain is under - employed and , even for his entertainment .
sarah k. , an individual child , as a little girl had fear of other children , often played they alone .
began their hallucinations , as you with 13 learned that the man that they can calls , since you thinking daddy , is not your leiblicher father .
because in visual and acoustic hallucinations same brain areas are active , the real impressions and noise process , it is also affected as sarah k. hard to distinguish , images and reality . ' every ' , ' says caste , will take place in the brain , the reality , there is .
hallucinations are also images , which the brain arise , therefore , they have so real . "
nighttime dream images also sees caste as a form of hallucinatory .
the hallucinations of healthy are not fundamentally different from those an acute psychosis .
unlike schizophrenic are mentally healthy in the situation , to recognise their contributed pictures as unreal .
caste advises his patients , therefore , that the hallucinations also as a special value ability .
border state between dream and hallucinatory
centred on to very awareness in our world will imaginary see , unfortunately , most pathologizing says michael schmidt - rapier hard , the clinic of psychiatry professor in heidelberg and chief doctor and psychotherapy of the florence nightingale - hospital in düsseldorf .
a psychosis is a serious , suffering full disease , but it also involves positive , creative - mania is also a work of art despair .
schmidt - rapier hard , the so-called oneiroide experience researched , has a special form of the dream of modified awake awareness .
oneiroide are highly complex , detailed quasi - dreams , the erlebende for real and which he is also in retrospect cannot distinguish from the state of the awake .
the oneiroide awareness state created in trauma or illness extreme situations , for example in polyradikulitis - see patients , the in full awareness of a motor paralysis .
if a person of itself - and world is threatened loss , for example by continuing total movement inability , it replaces the life - threatening imaginary world , the real situation through a own , detached from reality is , schmidt says - rapier hard .
a kind of border state between dream and hallucinatory .
since the management of a situation in the reality is not possible , a world exchange is taking place , but the real situation will be made in the imagination in mind .
an intensive form the foundation and a sense of meaning in a intolerable situation , the us human beings shape , not enables own submerged in nothing of loss of awareness .
everything is real , also later in the memory
also the züricher art historian peter cornelius claussen describes his oneiroid - experiences in his book " heart change " as the rescue action of the soul .
it is 49 years old , as its awareness for a heart valves operation followed by a heart transplant posted on travel , while his body on the intensive care is condemned to standstill .
visited claussen a appeared in a world made itself , foreign times and places : it is seen as bettlägerigen , old man , on board of a zugsanatoriums , a robot guards his health .
he lives in the early middle ages under royal , the manufacture of drugs from blood .
will of a greeks in motorcycle on the country abducted , browses with his hospital bed in firn snow of the alps and is a korean mafioso .
he is entirely to be done in the imagined that everything is real , later in the memory .
these internal travel for claussen , is radically different from any dream .
dream is a other state , be he describes .
quite the contrary , i am the memories travel from mental still after years and in secondary details about clear .
clearer and more intensive even than really what happened .
goes beyond the intensity of this erlebens the horizon of our other life secular experience , says the psychiatrists schmidt - rapier hard .
ultimately show oneiroide , psychoses , hallucinations and drugs binge , how fragile our internal reflections of external reality also in the ensure are .
any change of the state of awareness of the psychologist caste , say , ' can lead to an verformung of , what we call reality . '
an experience , which can also be enriching .

auβerdem those who are not many kilometres back in the year , the , too , i , the only with a buy - stop version 2.0 petrol engines with 150 ps is available .
be the only negative in this model is but a high price , the between 21.770 euro for the model luxury and 23.270 euro for the test wariness model sportive is .
than return to this high price , however , the mazda3 offers us , every day new highest driving passport .
a first with much glamour
l. example is the red tepppich the sensuality for penélope cruz , nicole kidman and fergie from .
in the premiere of ' nine ' resonated with the stars , clothed in models , which will be as elegantly as sexy , more than ever . ( photographs : gtre online ) .
elegantly our ' pe ' , as always , opted for a dark ' lady ' - dress .
the promises of fonpeek
peek is äuβerst limited , a device , with the can only be read his e- mails , without a possibility , able to see certain annexes or able to surf around the internet .
enjoyed glory , it has its five minutes as it chose the magazine time to one of the products of the year .
it on the straβe to see , is unlikely , but the idea in itself is nevertheless especially for young people of interest .
in contrast to the smart phones costs very little peek and has a very favourable unmetered access , for example , just the half of the price of a iphone the flat rate .
after the companies has seen the success so that , there has two new equipment in the market : one , which is intended only for twitter , the other with a life free service for data , unlike the peek , in which you pay a price six times higher .
fonpeek , which was presented yesterday in the event le web , the european version of this invention and is thus your third version .
it has the same limits , as his american counterpart , but has a surprise one .
maintenance of the monthly price for the telephone , around eur 12 in the month , includes roaming for the whole of europe .
those who with a smartphone to travel the world know already , what it means , on all the data must not , in order to be able to read his e- mails , as soon as we the country has cross , or when we desperately after a café with wifi addiction ( or with a link opportunity fon ) .
the idea of the roaming with flat rate is incredibly tempting and really should be possible for a long time .
it is true that some telephone providers already specific offer contracts and prices for stays abroad , but in my experience , it needs already a doctorate in physics and a good lens , in order to be able to read all the small print .
the repeated criticism on the part of the european commission in terms of affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of europe remained almost always ignored .
auβerhalb of their own country has always be afraid to read his e- mails and rightly so .
that a small machine as fonpeek ( with it but always astonishing is that it has the behalf fon , although it has no wifi / wlan ) can offer this kind of tariffs , that means the telephone providers , slowly but surely , is rethink and must start in various possibilities to consider , as you can use their data network .
kindle is another good example of this , in its prices is the downloaded of books and other questions contained in the internet .
without vetrag and without snags .
it is a capable of internet equipment and one is paying only a single time , namely the purchase , and not month by month .
and that is precisely what this is what i expect , also one day of fonpeek , life for a long time , a purchasing possibility of internet access as it peek already offered in the united states .
and that is not because i would like to buy it .
i would like to thank my e- mails , with the phone read .
but i expect this , because i am of the opinion that it would be a appropriate model for the consumer .
it would be interesting , however , is time to see a computer with the same system .
the fetish colour of michelle
yellow is , without a doubt , the favourite colour of the american first lady .
already in the office of barack obama as president of the united states they have appeared in a dress and re- elected a mantle of the colour and has the same colour to him in his , without doubt , the second most important moment in his life to accompany : the award of the nobel peace prize in oslo .
michelle obama has very similar models on two occasions : auβer that it was almost the same colour - a shining green yellow - , the clothing from three parts - dress , jacket and coat - the same substance , and it has contributed something groβförmig gesticktes or a halskette .
it even goes as far as that had the first sight it seems that the first lady of the united states wanted to follow the example of the princess of asturias and had decided , the same dress in more than just an occasion to bear .
however , the two clothes but very are produced in the stoffart , from which they are .
in the official introduction it has a dress from top and in oslo one from gemusterten office .
also the accessories were different : the first time green footwear with half high paragraphs and the second time a änhliches model , but gold paints .
also the hair was different : each time the hair were on this occasion than haarkranz of high , with the previous it has set the hair openly .
75 % of the working mothers , because of their maternity problems are given in the work
discrimination in the work has increased in the past years , especially in the younger women , the want to have children .
to this result is the of csic study carried out in cooperation with the institute for women ' fertility and career of women in spain ' .
the survey 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt : 75 % of working women see their career opportunities on the labour market restricted because of their maternity .
open the study , that it very broad differences in the decision , to a family reasons and the number of children are , according to whether or not the women work and if so , what kind of professional exercise them .
those of you who auβerhalb of the house not carry out other activities , only part-time work or no have firmly work treaty will be more mothers and have more children .
in contrast the women postpone , with a fixed employment , particularly in the public sector , that is why the creation of a family and motherhood and have also fewer children .
' the women in the age group between 35 and 49 years , with a fixed employment get their first child on average only 3.7 years after the pooling , a figure , for to 4.1 years for women with an increased employment , the taken longer to have to achieve this and draw together the her and the first child is only have achieved much later .
auβerdem has also the type of work , if a groβen influence on motherhood also less than the calendar with regard to the moment of conception willingness , " says the csic - researcher , margarita delgado .
the level of education is a further factor , the the age of women must be taken into account when the marriage and the first child .
according to the survey is the age the time of the marriage and the first child , the higher the higher the level of education and training .
this difference could also be found in the same age of women .
for example , the women in the group between 35 and 49 years ago , according to whether they only have the main school or a higher education , on average each with 25,1 or 32,1 for the first time mother .
also there is still , according to their level of education , a further difference between the women .
while the women with main final conclusion before their first permanent employment marry and have their first child , make it the women with a medium- sized or high school exactly the other way around and seek only a permanent employment and marry later and have their first child then , is delgado .

cowardly aggression
my 70 -year-old mother was last week by our part in the municipality of wander fuenlabrada , when a group of young people suddenly between 15 and 18 years alongside their and our dog herliefen , our dog is a mischling that we have obtained from the animal home and the just six kilo is , and then from the blue missed you him two fußtritte and injured it so difficult .
our indignation it is not in words , since it is us incomprehensible where since the spass in a cheap agression against a small and defenceless animal should be , which has of course been carried out at the leash .
added to that is the suffocation attack , the weather was walking a woman who received , than they these people because of the incident wise wanted to , it feared even their own lives , because if such a raving attacked a dog , it is also the same perhaps with a mr or mrs of a child , an elderly probably even with every make that he himself is the weaker than .
normally the incident occurred in a calm city quarter at five p.m. on an ordinary tuesday .
has the dog geheult the whole day .
we have of course in a close to police service , but , we have reported grave doubts about whether that will bring anything at all and in order to prevent any prejudice from the outset , we only want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals spaniards were .
our indignation about what has happened has led us , this incident .
we will not be able to understand what must be in the minds of these young people , that they find a cheap attack on a defenceless animal fun , of an animal , the us love , there is society , and friendship .
do we know where the good education and the respect for the animals and the people have remained .

increasing the sale of small lorries again something to
begins , after almost two years the car market for small transporters finally see some light at the end of the dark tunnel .
the 9.425 vehicles , the in november in spain were allowed , mean an increase of 12.6 % in relation to the year 2008 , and , what is still much more important is that they are so that the first increase at all after 22 successive months with constant decline , gemäβ the association of anfac and the car dealers by manufacturers association ganvam presented figures .
however , this good figures are time only with groβer caution to genieβen , as the reference data used for the comparison of november 2008 are , that a particularly bad verkau year with a reduction of 60 % in respect of the previous year was .
however , we must bear in mind that , apart from the increase in the last month , the overall authorisations still this 11 months of 40 % below the sales figures of the previous rules year .
since january , as a whole were 95.853 vehicles sold , in this number , but all vehicles , from which the vans market is , include : descendants of passenger cars to pick - ups , easier small vans , small vans and lorries / chassis .
furthermore , are still in the sky , which demand the same storm clouds in , because also affect the most if some of the vehicles be bought by individuals , the groβteil of sales to small and medium- sized enterprises , which in almost 100 % of all cases , the purchase by a third funding working .
so we must these restrictions , what the result of the tap turned the lending institutions are further factors with einschlieβen , such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the continuation of the poor economic situation .
in this panorama and in the difference to the cars , have the financial aid for the purchase of a vehicle of the plan 2000e little helped .
however , this plan is not only for private determines people , including self- employed and small companies to have a right , if they are a small carrier up to 3.5 tonnes with a co2 ausstoss , which must not exceed 160 grams per mileage , want to buy , but the low sales figures speak for themselves .
just yesterday again had ganvam reminded that it is part of the state necessary , is also a special emphasis on these small lorries , as well as , of course , for the industry vehicles ( lorries and buses ) .
predicted the car dealers association for the year 2010 a similar year such as the just last , for which it with a sales ( of default in passenger cars and offroad vehicles ) by 19 % .
brake exercises in the support in critical situations is now duty
as was already in the anti- lock braking bremssystem ( and as it now happening with the esp stability control , the aid systems must become the brakes in cases of emergency will be a duty equipment in the european cars .
indeed , they are duty in all newly registered passenger cars and light small trucks , for the remaining vehicles a karenzfrist until the end of february 2011 was set .
adopted by the european union the maβnahme has the objective , to improve the protection of fuβgänger , however , these braking systems because of their work , also help to prevent , many front - rear collisions .
is the task of the brake assistants , more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical brake on the basis of the system maneuver , carried out by the drivers brake strength on the brake recognises to exercise .
however , is not until the end this pressure from this system .
according to a commissioned by the component manufacturers for the bosch vehicles study , a third of the drivers involved in an accident was not before the toss together even more to do it , on the brake to enter into force and half of them had not with full force slowed down .
up to 1.100 accidents
the brake aid against attacks with maximum force in the braking system a and reduced by the brake time and thus also the brake gap , the a car in the brake process back .
according to a study in the eu could up to 1.100 fatal accidents every year , in which fuβgänger harm to come , be prevented , if all cars equipped with this type of emergency braking assistants would be .
it would be even less accidents - it is estimated that every fourth accident with personal damage be prevented could - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems be popular .
then the vehicle is equipped with a system , the ( on radar or a camera ) obstacles and recognises the drivers warns , with a light at the same time pressure on the brakes .
if the driver subsequently responded , helps him the system , to increase the pressure on the brake , it would be necessary .
if the drivers together not respond to the warning and even if the toss is already inevitable , , the brake assistant the maximum pressure on the brakes from , in this way , to keep the damage as low as possible .
general motors postpones the plan for opel until january
while the workforce of the opel plant in figueruelas ( zaragoza ) already by nick reilly , the new chairman of general motors ( gm ) europe , have been informed that meriva the production of the new at will start in the first week of april , probably on 8 , according to javier ortega , the american car manufacturers of pointing out that it needs more time , in order to bring the rescue plan for opel to a conclusion .
nick reilly , the chairman of the new , by gm europe wants to achieve , namely the fact that the affected side their assent on each individual point of the plan is already in advance .
and for this reason , it may be that the final document , the first workers and then the governments of the countries , in which there are works , is presented , until the beginning will postpone 2010 .
dementgegen will by gm assured that , in the next few days , it will take a decision regarding the sale of saab .
because it is not surprising that the swedish government the pressure on the american car has increased , so that this a decision as soon as possible .
gm are , to be in contact with a number of possible new buyers .
one of these buyers could be geely , the also would like to buy up volvo , however , the option of dutch manufacturer the skyper - sports , by the group of the russian converg backing has , ever stronger support .
if it with any of these buyers should come to an agreement , could gm some assets to the chinese baic sell .

on the tax of porsche boxster spyder
for the development of their latest and very expensive jewel used the engineers the boxster s as a basis and it really managed to make it easier to 80 kilos , which he now brings only 1.275 kilos of balance .
abandoning in order to create something you as a first to the automatic aufklappbare roof , which has been replaced by a tent screen roof with manuellem driving , so that we alone has saved 21 kilo ; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model such as the gt3 ' disappearance ' further 15 ; by the exclusion of the climate plant nor time 13 ; auβerdem the tank of 64 to 54 litres of fuel has been reduced , so that have been further 7 kilo ; saved by the installation of sporting bacquet - are still time , 12 and with the slight 19 - customs - wheels again saved five .
then it was also still by the renunciation of the audio - system 's cdr 30 once again six kilos less and through the exchange of türgriffe handles from substance which lack kilo achieved .
although it also with the gear box double clutch wheels pdk available is , the test was carried out with a vehicle with 6 - conventional hand wheels , mainly on the smaller landstraβen of california , to mountain routes , the really very kurvig were .
in his driving behaviour we can only give the mark irreproachable him .
has the reduction of its weight but no if led that he now no longer so sure would be on the straβe .
rather , the opposite is the case : since long we have already no longer such a small and light model test dangers , the a but also a feeling of groβer security in the curves , even in high speed , are .
able to do this , it is a small athlete , its muscles in a low motion in the necessary time to make warm , until we , to give him the orders lawn to curb to recover and then again to get everything from his engine ...
he makes everything what he says . the car power everything , what we him with our hands at the wheel indicate that , thanks to its steering , which is as communicative as also precise .
and he makes it with the precision of surgeons .
engine of a sound for all tastes
the sound of his v6 boxers with 320 ps ( 10 more than the boxster s ) is very managed and it can it be increase with the ' sport ' - option and by means of a system , the engine noise can change , which already in the panamera used for the first time .
brutally the speeding up assets is inconceivable , whether from the are or the renewed speed up .
the federungen strong , however , are not severe or inconvenient .
the asphalt on the landstraβen , on which we with the boxster spyder went , was already quite damaged , but the car meisterte the bumps well .
had the electronic assistants to the whole of the route almost nothing to do ; and the , although we in some of these curves ice in the grey and tomorrow rollsplitt took this morning .
in summary we can say that it is an ultra - easy car , a car , with whom you have an indescribable driving passport has , as it otherwise rather rarely are and there is much more than just a small improvement in him of the boxster ss .
the car will come in february 2010 on the market and will cost eur 70.831 .

pays the baskonia to a victory in israel itself
the caja laboral celebrated , despite the many fancy players in the team mr against mr ivanovic , an excellent triumph with 82 - 91 in his visit in the complicated fuβballfeld of maccabi electra and so , on the first place within his group after the groβartigen appearance of mirza teletovic , was the triple the best of his team with eight ( 29 in the assessment ) .
could the team from vitoria the significant loss of herrmann , oleson , huertas or micov by means of a very broad dose to use and replace team work , even if you wait until the bitter end to its victory muβten .
the great hit with 16 from the perimeter valued triple maβgeblich contributed to their final victory in .
began the game , with the leadership of the blue red , right from the start to the top table , on the advertisements .
since the first four baskets the team from vitoria already from the perimeter came , we have already seen guess that you on the playing field with well reheated hand gelenken were .
there were english and teletovic , mainly for the 18 - 20 were responsible at the end of the first quarter .
the second quarter was little different , only that the team from álava are for an internal way game of barac decided and for the game of judge eliyahu , in its return to the team with pfiffen and applause was received , be the home is , in order to further develop to break their advantage ( 34 - 43 ) .
teletovic already began as the best of his team with 13 points highlight , also wennn ' minus six ' assessment of the cluster can already guess lieβen that this would not be the best evening of brazilian .
nevertheless , despite the clear advantage in the break the game was not yet been decided and the makkabäer wanted the vitorianer remind you once again that not everyone wins on their playing field , and thanks to the attack always ' hand of elías ' , they were back into the game .
eidson and pnini helped crucial that the " yellow ' the helm umdrehten ( 50 - 49 ) .
still more disadvantages
mr the team of ivanovic , violated , but anything other than dead , had to a few game trains with prepare soundness in order to receive air to again , and in one of them was suddenly the gun of mirza teletovic , the with three almost successive triple and with the support of english and ribas ensured that advertisements on the table again a more reassuring gap by ( 54 - 67 ) been notified , the host at the end of the third quarter with ( 57 - enhance 67 ) could .
the alavesen have been in the last quarter bloβ and english and san emeterio ( 60 - 75 ) , already announced that they would allow anyone , to give you the victory that you , in the first dreiβig minutes honest deserved , taking back .
nevertheless , resigned pnini and eidson , not the best of their team and tried , your team by three points of the line ( 70 - 77 ) force to be .
nevertheless , and although cluster because fouls being made by the place , mr the team of ivanovic was not on , defended good and even though the israelis are still in the last minute aufholten ( 80 - 85 ) , the game have already had lost a victors and tel aviv for the first time in this season .

the team from malaga had neither fear of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship before the opposing team , which is perhaps one of the most of europe and has a lot of money .
thanks to your offer game in first quarter were the andalusian start to dream . a aggresive defence and three successive three times , two by omar cook and a by guillem rubio , the host with 12 - 18 - in the minute of 9 .

began to be , warm weather at last the greek team and its superiority on both game halves , while the departure of the englishman joel free country as a result of a violation of and the three itself caused error by carlos jiménez significant traces in the standardisation caja behind lieβen .
under their players in the field of interior and the lithuanian before linas kleizas players , with its triple , they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44 - 32 .

after the most tempting days since last spring , in which the inflation of assets to the prevailing mood of the markets was , on the markets is returned the insecurity , which is in any case surprising , because this is their natural state , in an environment in which the broker decisions on an inherently uncertain future meeting .
it was the maβnahme applied to the stabilisation of the markets , to pay the debt with the direct purchasing of assets and indirectly to the liquidity free hand in interest rates , the move to the zero claim , so that in this way the banks assets to buy .
the central banks have already confirmed that the end of assets as well as directly purchases are , and without their heterodox policy to the liquidity in question , start to spread , some sand in the wheels , as the bce näc already having eighth with their year auction , which will take place next week .
therefore the investors doubt the capacity of the world economy , the economic recovery without this heterodox maβnahmen maintain and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums .
the flüchtigkeiten the stock markets and the differences in the companies bonuses increase , even if they are still far removed from the paramilitary normal amounts , the they achieved at the beginning of the year .
the states have been forced to nationalize private risks and the state debt to rise again .
we will now again on quality and the united states , japan and germany , are the privileged refuge of the investors , resulting in an increase of the differences in respect of the countries of the euro area leads to germany .
spain has until now hardly affected by this episode of instability , but then came standard & poor 's and threatened with a new revision downwards in the assessment of spain .
damages on the other hand a degree of uncertainty is not , in order to silence the defenders of the moral risk , the once again had tried , in the responsible an awareness of the world economic policy , for what they had caused , to produce , since they the devastating effects , to which the restriction of credit had led to the loss of jobs , slowed down , when you actually a new day for the thanks action beschlieβen should have .
nevertheless , what has happened in dubai , there is a tribal war between the emiren , in order to restore the power in the emirates and the development in greece was also foreseen earlier .
conceals a government , what the state debt , elections , and a new government , at the same thing .
prodi made it in italy after berlusconi and sócrates in portugal after durão barroso .
it makes no sense that ecofin hungary from the beginning of the year not save fulfilment of its foreign payments and thus a euro - member country is allowed , not to honour its commitments .
however , it is logical that ecofin has forced the greek government , to be transparent and its citizens with the need of auβergewöhnlicchen maβnahmen with in the duty to take , to maintain the stability of the state money .
yes , we are as expected before a episode of normalisation of risk premiums , after some excesses to high amounts , the now within the expected would lie .
in the case of spain , we must not worry , as long as the differences the state of debt with the same speed as the european companies bonuses increase .
reduce should , however , the european differences and would further increase the spanish , dannn it is a special spanish risk action .
the standard & poor 's is a farce . while the here early indicators a groβteil the research institutions of the market forces , preferable to their scenarios for the recovery and to correct their scenario for 2011 upwards einschlieβlich the ocde and of the european commission , the re- with a japanese scenario for the spanish economy , all the promises despite warnings no long life span .
once again , it seems quite that it is an excellent opportunity to buy spanish share , although in the moment " caution in the drive ' is needed .

the chairman of iberdrola , ignacio sánchez galán , as the first met yesterday before the subcommittee of the parliament where , in these days the strategy in relation to the energy supply spain will be debated in the next two decades .
after his appearance , on the gas natural - fenosa , the chairman of rafael villaseca followed , was galán some of the key points of the press about what he had made under the committee behind versschlossenen doors .
according to the chairman of iberdrola must spain 50 billion by 2020 euround further 60 billion from this date invest by 2030 , under the pretext that the current nuclear power stations also remain in operation continue .
this should not be the case , would not on the investment needed 60 billion , but to 95 billion .
iberdrola of the opinion that it is , however , no longer into an increase in the energy production capacity should invest , but in distribution networks and international groupings .
from 2020 onwards , the question will change and we should increase the performance .
be proposal focuses on both gas and coal works of co2 capture with bodies and particularly , of course , on the renewable energy sources .
in this case he assumes that 18,000 mw more are needed , under the pretext of course , by other ' support energy ' .
galán is , of the opinion that the gesetentwurf for a sustainable economy , which has just adopted by the government , is in line with what his company has called for , in no case wanted to say something against this law , such as incentives for the national coal consumption to create what , exactly the opposite of all the political strategies in the fight against climate change would be .
his opinion ' , long term , we clearly in this direction , despite some ' individual ' maβnahmen , as you described the chairman of iberdrola .
be that as it is galán believes that we , as of now , the decisions to the investment , even if these are long term , should make , since it will need some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created , in order to tackle it .
