sorting - the waste container in brno smell not well
in prague , the people the drinks packaging sorting , in the south moravian towns will be back on step and enters the sorting waste container .
and in brno ?
there should be a few minutes reserve , in order to find the appropriate waste tonnes .
i am not saying that the waste separation in brno would be unable to operate at all .
but it is me above , al if the gentlemen of the council is inadequate take care of this problem , even if we are the second biggest city in the republic .
brno finds itself in the waste divide in the jungle league , not only because we as citizens here in the sorting container always only dispose of paper , glass and plastic must , but , above all by the mülltonnen number for such waste .
you have some time in the centre tried , for example , the pet bottles in a basket of collection to dispose ?
that is the art , above all , it needs time and nerve .
accidentally found in the up until now the only body , which i have taken is that of moravia place towards the goose .
mr onderka us his colleagues should not get angry , but that strikes me far too little .
apart from the fact that the waste separation is also in other parts not honey simple .
whole ranks my friends sorting this waste would prefer not to do anything .
from laziness .
it is that you too far to the waste tonnes .
i am not surprised .
i have even after the ceremony offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles .
but on the konicova streets in sight , i have no colour mülltonnen seen .
fortunately i came in road bahnfahren in the right place .
ran the waste but almost on .
this is still the centre of brno , thus making the whole city is represented , not true ?
however , ecology and any kind of aesthetics the brünner socialists probably cold .
they prefer to buy the city of an ice hockey league , the us in the whole of the republic disgrace power , rather than to buy a few more tonnes of waste and the sorting further raw materials for a cleaner brno to offer .
i am glad that i was able to confirm my assumption also with official statistics , after i have sought a while on the internet .
eko after the data of society - com is brno really in whole district south moravia worst since .
has the " paroubek ' - budget deprive them of the money for pensions and health money
after the left - wing party despite the view of the government gave money to the farmers and officials , more , is no money in the budget for pensions , health and building society rules more money available .
but also not for the public debt interest or for the international court disputes .
which caused the even more problems , the in the second half of next year at the government will be , says the finance ministers , eduard janota .
than the social democrats and communists have implemented the salary increase for some groups , they expect to see the government , the money for the sensitive expenditure , pensions or for the health borrows money in addition . " this is only a postponement of the problems in the future , mines , " says janota .
from the loans will exclude always pay higher interest rates , and we must eventually have to return the money .
too much to choice , where the state coffers are empty .
if the social services or costs for the state are business , not be reduced tax on the increase .
for all the , which left - wing party now , the teachers were more money : the fire - fighters , the farmers .
later and also for their children .
with the pensions or the health of money , the account of 1.8 billion have disappeared , people must have no fear , they receive this money .
but at the price that the state debt - in the next year will be even more so in the state coffers lack not only 163 billion , but far more .
despite the efforts of the minister janota the debt will increase as ever more quickly and together with this , the cost and interest rates .
the state is the need for the money to compensate , then already will no longer suffice to increase the value added tax slightly or to cut the maternity money , as the government in its against deficit - package .
because of the externalisation of the money will be in favour of certain groups of voters in next year also five billion for development of motorways and railways lack .
it is mainly the sections gained from the competition , which we can no longer new projektieren and perhaps cheaper .
received the very most , which is also not free of charge .
this means delay or cancellation of thirty great buildings , is also the europe - money creation warns that the spokesman of the ministry of transport , karel hanzelka .
the cssd has proposed that it solves the flow of money afraid - they attacking cez stock dividends , with which the state owner of the majority is , and then the money from this in the transport fund would become active .
the problem is that the level of dividend is never certain and it is by no means a source of endless .
fins from last year cez 18 billion in the budget .
every year will be paid from the liquidations environmental damage - the dividends , topped up the pension account and this also serves as a reserve for the money planned pension reform .
with this trick rising moreover , following the rules of the eu , the actual budget deficit to the nieveau by 5.7 % gdp .
this brings to an end but not yet the carnival - of the transformations .
almost three billion sank the budget for various compensation for victims of communism , and of criminal offences or for expenditure for the court disputes , even for the bausparen .
manage without this money , whether the state is not safe .
this is pure gambling .
if we lose an international court dispute , then we need to pay anyway , this makes janota clear .
save the money , then the minister , we must portfolio internally or in the worst case scenario , the government budget reserve attack .
one hundred million lack also for the two billion already begun ' treasury ' project , which is intended to enable on- line to monitor , for as regards the individual authorities spend the money .
launching the first step in january .
should the finance ministers find the money not elsewhere , the project should be stopped and in this case come sanctions , warned janota .
dominate their next smartphone will be two operating systems
expect the americans for the future with a mobile phone , on the user by pressing a single button between various operating systems could tune .
presented the plans are promising .
it is , only to push a button and , for windows mobile , within a few seconds in exchange android .
wants to precisely such a possibility the american society vmware imagine , mainly focused on the development of the virtual softwares for the computer .
we allow them to the mobile phone two users profiles at the same time to carry out .
you can switch between this , you will be able to deal with those in two separate home and work profiles .
both are work in parallel , indicated by the company vmware srinivas krishna murti the interview for the magazine computer world .
it was presented in november last year and a few days ago for the first time shown .
on the market will come in 2012 .
virtualization the smart phones is not the fiction .

snow lack on the mountains plaguing the hotel owners
scneelose pisten make sorgenn not only the giant mountains - residents .
the lack of snow discourages the appointment of the people of ski stay in hotels and pensions .
therefore we can in giant mountains still free rooms for all winter dates incl . christmas and new year 's eve received .
visited our pages are often .
by the people go offers , note the prices , but now they are afraid to appoint binding .
and if you ask us to call it immediately , whether our opinion , the christmas this year on snow or ' on matsch ' will be that the operators in the information portal spindl.info , martin jan dura .
who the new year 's eve - residence in the spindel mill exactly to his ideas , should no longer with the appointment hesitate .
preferred who saving and in which the quality of the stay only in second place , the can try to wait a few days for .
offer the spindel mill hotel owners now for the silvestertag largely only weeks stays .
i think that they are still a long time , will endeavour to sell them , but then they too must give , and on shorter times .
and then the free rooms will quickly dwindle , jan dura estimated .
free beds in all winter dates always provides always also the travel office ing tours in vrchlabi .
now we are most interested in the christmas week , which is not yet been sold out .
in our offer is approximately half of the jobs still freely .
therefore we have already prepared some cheaper christmas stays for the last moment that the director of the travel agents ing tours , petr schiefert .
the silvestertag in giant mountains the vrchlabi travel office can also offer , but there is much less free jobs .
good paragraph will also find the first fortnight in february , the remaining winter deadlines be sold on average .
in this year is the interest for the winter stays also negatively affected by the fact that in giant mountains is always no snow .
the people will wait and see whether snow falls .
nobody wants to spend the year in the mountains without snow .
should the pisten within a week verschneit be , will also be the christmas compromising , believes schiefert .
reversed and a little better than in last year , we will succeed in the room in the hotel horizon in pecpod snezkou to occupy .
we are about five per cent better than last year .
on silvestertag to christmas and we have just a few more free rooms .
there is a great deal of interest in the polish holidays in janua , and in february , the rules will also go well , informed the director of the best pec hotels , karel rada .
for 80 % of the new year 's eve stays is also the hotel omnia the central parking in janske lazne occupied .
object is to be christmas in the most recent hotel in janske lazne still half of the beds freely .
pleasant struck us in the january this year , for which we are currently occupied already around 60 % .
now is a bit weaker the february , but at the moment is , if the snow , certainly also increases the interest in the hold - ups in the giant mountains , the director of the hotel omnia , erik sporysch .
waiting for a greater snow mess the giant mountains hotel owners now .
on thursday it should be allowed to cool down and if it comes to rainfall , should that be on the mountains snow .
but then again a warming is supposed to come , informed jiri jakubsky from the location of the czech weather office in hradec kralove .
united states : repetition is the mother of wisdom
it is almost funny , with which pupils strebsamkeit barack obama , the president with his reputation of the brightest , his predecessor 's strategy in the issue of afghanistan , repeatedly , the he felt even the most stupid .
when he finally its eagerly awaited afghanistan - doctrine ausschwitzte , it was that he this on the copying paper from the bush - iraq szenariovor abschrieb three years .
not only that he in the text itself on several occasions used the expression ' as in the iraq ' , it has even the name of the bush statement of january 2007 as the name of its own declaration : ' new way forward ' used , without hesitation .
he has even three years ago the bush idea - fresh contingents in the troubled by the civil war iraq to send in their conclusions , as the ' irresponsible and karastrophische criticised decision ' .
subsequent months but showed that the recommendations of the military outgoing bush strategy the only possible and was very successful in the sense that we in the news about iraq today no longer speaks at all .
bush 's reputation this has not improved , because he has his successor objectively behind a much dankbarere starting situation , when it was to be expected .
barack obama in afghanistan hopes , that the miracle repeating itself .
in order to increase the contingent of troops have him again asked the military , especially the upper stanley mccristal - general , the operation commander of the afghanistan - even despite the subordination habits the vacillating protect in the white house hard criticised .
40,000 soldiers he called for , in order to be able to reverse the situation for the better .
hesitated the president three months , but it is to have a better idea and so he has the general wenistens defrauded of 10,000 soldiers .
pressed from europe he has the promise of another 5,000 , even if he myself initially at least with 10,000 expected .
highly problematic in the whole strategy of obama is be projects , to withdraw the troops from afghanistan as early as 18 months , and to conclude this process within three years . the whole obama - doctrine leaves than answers more questions .
some of us , doubt that the increase in the same effect as the measure halved in the iraq will bring .
also , despite the brother of recent years , the iraq war - society relatively well - structured , their leaders honour the values .
the afghan situation is characterised by the counter indication - on no one can be kept and there will be no agreements rely .
under such conditions , it is difficult , prepare for the afghan security forces , which are accustomed , every day to change their mind .
the political institutions , even if they have been set up formally correct , remain just a veneer buildings , which will excel towards the patriarchal tribal relations further .
the balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated , particularly due to the confusion of the conditions , the pakistan and iran - complicate influences even further .
also the building of a viable ' state ' , which is the minimalist aim of the whole operation , is unrealistic .
time horizon of the obama - strategy surprised by his voluntarism
over the last eight years , only in the situation in afghanistan has deteriorated further and now it is on the brink of explosion .
believe that the small soldiers who in the war cries about the ' early return ' has broken out , are a miracle , can only create a truly romantic soul , which will not impress the facts .
from the political view is the date for the withdrawal of troops mere irresponsibility , because the taliban , as the american defeat , receive the indirect confession .
the last nato summit showed that the willingness of europeans , is to participate in the battles in afghanistan , is running out .
europe politicians cannot and will also not explain to their voters , the way in which the security germany or italy with the war in the hindu kush - mountain connected .
another possible factor , which can influence the situation radically , is the development of the events in iran .
should continue to worsen the situation and the increased sanctions on the iranians not work , for the united states a very serious question arises whether the problem is not with troops to resolve .
this question must be answered in the period , in which america after obama withdrawal from afghanistan is the winner .
any solution will but also mean a dramatic turn of the afghan situation .
the only comfort for barack obama is the fact that there is still remain three years until the presidential election , and therefore there is still enough time , so that it can resort to another strategy , fallls this prove total default would .

i believe that the wall street on further direction is aware , in which it has to go , the former bankers the jpmorgan , douglas elliott , of society .
the problem lies in the details , it added .
goldman sachs made to the target of criticism , after you for the first three quarters almost $ 17 billion this year had set aside for premiums bonuses .
the overall level of premiums bonuses in the course of this jahra will , after the agency reuters probably despite , too , the measure reported today exceed 20 billion dollars .
the high - premium bonuses in the banking sector , with the start of the financial crisis in a series of länders become the most controversial political issue .
britain reported on wednesday that it intends to exceed the bankers ' bonuses , the 25,000 pound unique , with a tax of 50 % to burden .
similar steps is also preparing france .
in this year the prizes have women in all disciplines won , except in physics .

everyone has this prize , the nobelmedaile of the diploma and certificate on the acquisition of the prize money received .
ten million swedish kronor the is in each category .
if there are several prize in each category , the price of money will be distributed amongst them .
tradition in accordance with the american president , barak obama , has the most expected already received nobel peace prize in oslo today afternoon .
he has recognised the kontrovere his appointment in his speech , because it is only the beginning of its path , and , furthermore , in the tip of the country is , the two wars lead - in the iraq and in afghanistan .
in respect of its policy , but he added that wars in certain situations for the fight of the world peace is necessary , even if the price is heavily for doing so .

light secret via norway dissolved : the russians have successfully tested a missile
via norway was a special light effect unknown origin to observe .
ministry of the russian defence has admitted that not only yesterday the norwegian border an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested .
again the start , however , was not successful and the rocket described as a type " bulava that originally should be the pride of the russian army , is slowly to the nightmare of the russian generals , as well as the prime minister vladimir putin .
also its repeated presence on the ground at the missile test has had no positive effect on the success of the test flights .
bulava is usually not launched at all or in the air has been damaged .
in the russian newspapers writes we already debating the ' bulava ' than a rocket ' that not flying ' .
not a rocket , the shining flies , but
this was already 13 attempt at the beginning of normal .
only again at the end of the flight are technical damage to the rocket have emerged .
probably the engine exploded in the third missile stage .
this time launched ' bulava ' from the nuclear submarine dmitri donskij that under the white sea water .
this raketentyp allows for the launch of the submarine .
therefore , is probably that the mysterious caused by an unspecified fliegendes object light on north because , in fact , the damaged ' bulava ' was .
furthermore , the norwegians have for the first moment not doubt that it is a russian missile .
has this time the generals challenged and claims that it does not clearly can talk of a failure .
were not from the first two stages of the missile and affected by the accident was only the third stage .
in the previous cases have been at the same time the engines in the first stage damaged .
even if no test start without its faults , holds the leadership of the ministry of defence only six of the thirteen for unsuccessful .
almost 50 % of the success that is why the generals met with optimism and it will continue to claimed that the ' bulava " even without problems will be flying and even to ten hyperschall - nuclear warheads with a total weight of max . 1.15 tonnes will bear .

czech discovery : a substance , even in the variable tempered 's hiv viruses ,
testing the team of czech and the german scientists , the new links should prevent the spread of hiv viruses on the organism .
the main advantage of improved substance is that it is also in the viruses who already are resistant to medicines .
outweighs this fact against the disadvantage that the link in normal virus - does not so much variants , as one of the existing medicines .
the disease of aids cannot yet be curable .
the patients can the compilation of medicines but extend the life and prevent the proliferation of hiv viruses in the body .
their income will but accompanied by a number of side - effects .
incomplete repression of the virus reproduction has also the development sg . resistant viruses as a result , against the no medicines are more effective .
the work of the experts from three institutions of the academy of sciences cr , by the vscht ( both chemically - technological university ) prague and by the university in heidelberg opens the way in which we can deal with the virus - resistance .
you have shown that the substances referred to as metalokarborane effect on the protein substance , the responsible for expansion of hiv viruses is .
the metalokarborane are links on boron , hydrogen , carbon and cobalt .
these links the virus reproduction block on all other than medicines used today , therefore , they can overcome the resistance - problem .
in their work the scientists to new 's improved 's links , on the basis of the knowledge of molecular mechanism for linking it to the viruses - protein substance were prepared .
the metalokarborane have a unique three - dimensional structure : two vielfächige cages , which from boron - , hydrogen and carbon - atoms and by a metal - nuclear power , in this case cobalt , are linked .
pet tückisches and lasting virus
protease hiv is protein substance of the hiv virus , the for the life cycle of the virus is essential .
without the hiv virus - caused by the hiv protease division would create no tyres infection viruses particles .
if we switch off the hiv protease , we involve the increase in the body of the virus of the patients from , the scientists in the press , the report by the institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry the academy of sciences cr was issued .
in the work in the journal science newspaper of medicinal chemistry was published , describing the scientists whole ranks of links in which two couples the cages ( see table ) are linked through a brief organic chain , the then continues systematically to be changed .
weaker something , but reliable
the impact of this number of substances against the hiv - protease wurdne in a test tube tested , even against their constant ( resistant ) variants which have been won by hiv - infected patients .
the impact of metalokarborane on the usual enzyme variant , is not so much as the clinically used medicines , but it will not lose their effects on the resistant variant , against which the medicines used are often ineffective .
the unique mechanism and their further characteristics , such as the biological and chemical stability , low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical shaping , power metalokarboranen to interesting links for further research , focused on the development of effective anti- hiv drugs says pavlina rezacova , leader of the laboratories for structural biology of the institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics the academy of sciences of the institute .
dispute because budget . ods on fishing , the does
the chairman of the ods , mirek topolanek , the budget for the next year approved described as ' terrible ' and the government of prime by jan fischer should consider his opinion , their continued existence .
the expression of the ods the prime minister called as " strong worry " .
it is supposedly time for the analysis .
ods the vice - chairman , petr necas , said that this concept of officials cabinet with the support of the ods and cssd , green party obviously no longer works .
after necas , the prime minister must decide whether he intends to rely in parliament to the minority , when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit , or whether it be in order to remain in office through the parliament left .
this approach of the ods and the social democrats , to the issue of the public deficits is diametrically differently , necas has pointed out .
parliament has adopted on wednesday the budget for the year 2010 , but with left - wing party - amendments on more than 12 billion kronor .
parliament has the money for state officials ' salaries , for the maintenance of social services , increased for direct payments to farmers .
has the government keeping counter to the social democracy 's proposals that it conceals the budget deficit increase .
czech republic should with a backlog of 163 billion kronor economies .
the ods has left the chamber before the vote , it is the wish of the government , because also the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provisional . frase emergency clear
disappointment and futility
the finance ministers , eduard janota , spoke about his disappointment and a sense of futility led , while prime jan fischer has judged that the government , the current situation .
necas is convinced that , if janota seriously threatened with his resignation in the event , that the amendment proposals were approved , the situation would look different .
in accordance with the czech television has janota after the rules for monday government with the prime registered .
he has indicated that he be another remain in office .
reason to do so is his disappointment on the verhandugn of the budget .
extent to which fishermen for the further battle with the budget deficit , so that , in accordance with necas social democracy 's nominanten ( cssd ) , which imposed the changes in the budget , in the government had nothing to do .
the prime will also say clearly that he should resign , if parliament adopts continue deficit - enhancing laws , for example the , concerning the sickness pay and pensions , or the services law changed .
topolanek : the nominated by ods minister is not wrong
it is a matter of the prime minister fishermen and the whole government .
the ministers have not made mistakes , nominated by the ods has topolanek highlighted in the text news from the united states .
it has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function people who commit to top 09 who voted against the budget .
necas stressed that , if fishermen darür decides , to the fight against the deficit - level of public finances to renounce , " it is absolutely logical and correct that it is based on the left - wing majority , which is currently in the parliament ' .
then he supposedly with the support and tolerance of the citizens democrats cannot count .
i have not thought about it , and if it will be now , then i will deal so that , of the said citizens democrats nominated defence minister martin bartak the journalists in parliament .
prime fishermen afternoon the meeting of the european council flew to brussels .
ods the at the request of the prime minister resigned
necas emphasised at the same time that the ods probably on wednesday in the house would vote against the amended budget , if the prime the members of the citizens democrats would expressly ask that they enable the adoption of the budget .
we are not as orphaned children , we are not small children , so he responded then to the question of whether the ods when the political negotiating on the budget by its absence of the party chairman in the parliament and in the czech republic has not been pushed back .
i have not noticed that my vote would be lacking .
renounced the mandate as i already , i knew that it in the next few months , above all , by bolshevism parliament and destruction everything would be positive , responded topolanek itself .

directly to the greatest changes include the introduction of the new transport journey from de milo vice to prague , currently , the inhabitants de milo vice in lysa nad labem switch .
it is the fifteenth transport path of suburban transport system esko , whose opening thanks to the railway electrification from lysa nad labem after de milo vice is possible .
remote long- distance in the capital will be in the end goal station prague - central station .
leads the cd more lines sc pendolino between prague and ostrava a and the trains to be sumperk / jesenik in the time of travel two hours .
with the pendolino since 13 december , the passengers can no longer go to bratislava .
this year 's bill for regional railways : increase of 200 million
ordered the fast trains are and paid by the ministry of transport , as a whole receives the railways to reimburse the loss of so-called liquidity in the next year four billion kronor exact nature as , in this year . the local guidelines provide the districts , as a whole in next year they have to pay for eight billion kronor , with the state giving three billion .
in this year , the regional guidelines czech sek 200 million more expensive .
for the local guidelines , as well as the fast trains , the railway newly completed in the treaty of a ten - year , until now , the treaty , always has been completed only for a year .
praises the railways the system , perhaps that is why it has also not use of the increase in the price of the great majority of the tickets .
to change , it is only in one- day network fahrscheinen cd net and in favourable internet fahrscheinen eliska .

in the next few days , the new hollywood movie clint eastwoods in the american cinema ' invictus : the ungeschlagene ' , which is a part of the life history of the former president of the republic of south africa , nelsona mandela , includes .
has the role of the world - famous fighter against apartheid morgan freeman received , a few years ago , the already supposedly of mandela self- eye elects was .
apart from performers role of the legendary south african champions in rugby , francois pienaar , damon has received alike .

as president of the republic of south africa was he was elected in 1994 - 1999 .
great expectations will be set in the film , because it is in a time when the cinema , in the one hand , the preparations for the world cup in south africa culminate , at the same time , the media but the world public opinion with daunting news about the rising racial hatred and the discrimination of the population on the part of the black shaking dominant majority .
ap according to the agency are the reactions to the new film in south africa for the time being consistently positive , despite numerous reservations against the occupation of the main roles with american hollywood stars .

morgan freeman endeavours in the course of the film , two racial and since year and day defined each other population groups together and as nelson mandela in 1995 , it is also in its role in the south african national - rugby dress has won world field , the then south africa .
for the entering of the lawn in dress that applies in south africa almost as a sacred act , fourteen years ago harvest mandela great ovation , mostly from the white audience and won so that the recognition of the white population .
the rugby cup achieves it perhaps , the people once again to a single people together , the rugby players chester williams , which in 1995 was the only ' blacks ' in the national team .
whether the tense situation in south africa improved that will only show .
but the white south africans are sceptical about such as , for example , recent interview for ln of the rugby fan , christopher dawson , have betrayed , the fled from the country to the united kingdom .

jan worry about raises cases of slander against three head the cssd .
agency , the owner of the student radim jan worry about , collects today offence of defamation against three social - democratic leaders .
against michal hasek from the district of south moravia , from the district of radko martinek pardubice and the leader of the province of olomouc , martin tesarik .
jan worry about said so in a twenty - minute inteview journal on the radio .
the complaint is connected with the effort made by the company , the regional - train transport to engage in a number of districts .
all regions have but ultimately the long- term contracts with the czech rail signed .
heads of all three are singling us and say that we should take the cherries out , we have the supply only in terms of the scope , as it was agreed with you .
they claim that we are more expensive than the czech rail , because we were aware of the prices of the czech rail , the last week have been completed .
so we have no choice but to us to defend .
because of this defamation of society , student agency said jan worry about the radio journal .
at the same time , it led to that he has evidence from all the counties that they get their act in accordance with the european law have made .
that is why we are preparing a charge of the european commission .
hasek considers the collection of criminal proceedings for the further continuation of the average ploy by jan worry about , the him as a free advertising for its society and for his own person serves .
of course i am prepared my good name to defend in my local area , as well as the good reputation , and i also call upon further head on .
i assume that will also be clear on this issue , that it jan worry about is , in the cause of regional einsen rail transport and false manipulated public opinion and used false arguments , hasek said .
jan worry about reported last week that he have invested several million kroner in advertising , which will draw attention to the adverse step the counties .
the radio journal he said that he the campaign after christmas cut , and wants to continue with this after the new year .
he stated that it will lead the campaign against the corruption as such .
jan worry about the campaign has initiated , after the districts at the instigation of the regional rail transport with the czech rail agreed and for the task in a high to 150 billion kronor no tenders had put out to tender .
after vancura is a sort of behaviour by unlawful and in the contradiction with the requirements of the european court of justice .
because of the criticism of the rail transport in the districts of threatened him , according to jan worry about , also already a member of the cssd .
was the only threat , if we do not forego that we can then also lose the bus licences .
he turned out to be a member of the cssd above , i know , of whom are , i am not saying his name , said today jan worry about the radio journal .
vaccination against pneumokokken voluntarily free of charge , and
imfung against pneumokokken change from january the usual .
they should be treated as a first free of charge to the families and be voluntary .
but now to vote in that report the obligation - vaccination would be more effective .
the preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumokokken culminate .
institute of the medicinal products is already implementing the maximum prices of vaccines , which have to pay for the health insurance .
the experts are also on the vaccination procedures in the clear .
new vaccination
vaccines for august free - children
from january children can be vaccinated against pneumokokken free , on 2 august last year and later were born .
disturb the condition that they have not received any impfdosis yet .
who with the vaccination has already begun in last year or earlier , further repetition vaccination self- must also pay .
the first impfdosis between 3 and 5 life must be given month of the child .
already last year , a quarter of the family their children against pneumokokken vaccinate .
1600 paid the parents kroner and more for a dose .
needed for the vaccination of the youngest children are four doses .
as a whole , the experts estimate that the health insurance for the quantities 300 , 000 to spend sek 450 000 per year .
save you but in the treatment , which would need children without vaccination .
until now , the state has for all farmland vaccination of children spent around 500 000 per year .
the obligation - vaccination was introduced with the so-called janota package .
ear cause pneumokokken resources pneumonia , but also serious infections including brain skin inflammations and blood poisoning .
by pneumokokken infections are dying in us after investigation in hospitals per year up to 28 children under 10 years of age .
outside of the czech republic was the duty - vaccination of children against pneumokokken introduced in some 40 countries .
will the vaccination duty be ?
at the same time it is said that this vaccination in future duty could be .
from january it should be paid for by the insurance and voluntarily .
mentioned that the obligation - vaccination would be better , for example , the head of citizens ' association nahlas , mr rudolf kalovsky .
advertises its association you already pneumococcal vaccination in the long term .
the experts on the international conference , was involved in our union , were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination .
this is not ideal .
on the other hand , we are glad that we have managed to enforce is , at least the .
i believe that this is the road that we must go now , led kalovsky .
wants to the ministry of health but the vaccination proceedings against pneumokokken not change .
in this moment we consider the not at all , his spokesman said vlastimil sesen .
voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks , claim the doctors .
doctors , the chairman of the specialist society of practical children hana cabrnochova , is that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks .
if all children would be vaccinated , then we could consider the possibility of reducing the repetition vaccination number ' in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive , we understand the political decision that this vaccination was launched on a voluntary basis , " says allerdingst cabrnochova .
expect the experts , that more than 80 % of the parents their babies against pneumokokken inoculated from next year .
vaccination against pneumokokken is path - breaking it is also that this as a first land vaccination will be paid for by the health insurance and not by the state .
insurance companies should spend the money for the prevention , so that save it for further treatment , erkärt cabrnochova .
the doctors must buy the vaccines itself .
but this is a concern of the practical children doctors , the concerns the purchase the vaccines .
according to the original project should the vaccines are purchased by the insurance and the doctors receive them on the same way , as well as other vaccines issued by the state to you .
some members have feared , however , that the insurance as " the money from the health insurance could lead ' .
buy the doctors the vaccines itself and will therefore have to wait until the insurance you pay for them .
according to the estimates , the individual practical doctors will need to invest sek 40,000 per month , which is a significant amount of money .
this will not be easy , says cabrnochova .

labour defended budget - and tax rises
the ministers have the tax hikes and spending freeze , were announced in the voretat report , against the criticism of the opposition , the economic and trade unions defended .
conservatives said , alistair darling ' pass ' , would have an opportunity to show that it with reducing the deficit he meant by the decisions until after the election , postponed .
chancellor of the exchequer , also for came under fire that he sought to workers with low and middle - income .
among its main proposals were a 0.5 - % increase in social insurance and a 1 % ceiling of the public wage for 2011 .
social insurance trouble
the trade unions have protested that low wage earners be penalized for a recession , which they have not caused and warned against forthcoming ' problems ' .
increasing the social insurance - approximately gbp 3 billion per year – has angered the private sector , who says that this is a tax on jobs , while the emphasis should be on the economic recovery .
the increase , which is confined to those who , the earn more than £ 20 000 per year , will relate to roughly 10 million workers .
focal points of the preliminary budget report

2.5 % increase in state pensions
according to estimates of the office of the exchequer will someone with an annual income of £ 30,000 £ by 90 per year be poorer and someone with £ 40,000 per year will be £ 190 poorer , while a person with £ 10 000 annual income is 110 £ will be richer .
halving the minister said , its objective of deficit until 2013 means ' difficult decisions , " but you also said that 60 % of the burden of additional taxes on the 5 % of the top income would remove .
finance minister stephen timms denied that the outlined tax hikes and spending freeze , compared to the necessary measures ' would be a drop in the ocean ' .
' these are large numbers . they will give us the deficit halving bring and this is also beyond the period of the next four years is absolutely necessary ' he said the bbc with .
timms said that he is confident that the economy until the end of the year would return to the growth .
predictions of the labour party on the future economic growth – which the volume of new debt and the speed of the deficit be influenced removal – were challenged , after chancellor of the exchequer was forced to revise , former figures .
he said in its opinion , the economy will probably be in this year to shrink 4.75 % - much more than the drop of 3.5 % , the was predicted in april – while debt with £ 3 billion would be higher than previously estimated .
' missed opportunity '
the conservatives who wish to launch a new advertising campaign on thursday , in order to warn against the " debt " crisis of labour , said that the planned debt of gbp 789 billion over the next six years is untenable .
you added that the ministers have failed to produce a credible plan , as you will pay back this , and ' cynically ' difficult decisions until after the election a gear - must take place in june 2010 at the latest .
' you have nothing of importance , said about what it is going to do , ' said the shadow finance philip hammond . ' they had their own opportunity to do this , and you have leave it ' .

roger bootle , deloitte
labour insists that schools , hospitals and the police before any future cuts be preserved , unlike in the proposals by the conservatives , what the deficit capping quicker and more to see .
but the liberal democrats said that the money that will be gained through the tax hikes and spending freeze , will be used , in order to cover the expenditure for the next year , not , in order to reduce the deficit , and argue , therefore , that the plans are built on shifting sands " ' .
the political editor of the bbc , nick robinson , said that things at the time of the declarations - as the above inflation adjustment in some invalidity pensions in the next april – the chancellor of the exchequer suspend the charge of the vote fishing would , simply because the money could be brought back next year .
labour insists , to provide the extra aid , when people truly need them most and that the situation in september 2010 will be re- examined .

islam can be french ?
pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state .
at a time when the swiss electorate voted in favour of a ban on building of minarets and the concern about the alleged islamisation of europe is widespread , john bowen , an american academics , has a sound and thoughtful report written about it , whether muslims in one of the most avowedly säkularisier societies in europe can be integrated -- and be integrated .
some readers will this new book from admiration for the last work of the author : ' why the french no headscarves love ' ( original title : ' why the french don 't like headscarves read ' ) ( 2006 ) , an elegant and densely argumentierenden study a dispute that divided the country through more than one and a half decades and employees and their effects are still exercise today as well .
bowen 's neustes book offers a broader and more kühneres range .
as a good anthropologist would he not only like to know what the politicians and the media , on the islam say in france , but what happens in the area really .
he has spent months in mosques , schools , and institutions , the now the 5 to 6 million muslims in france , as bowen calls it " islamic provide freedom ' .
he is a good listener , it gives debates between teachers and students , on the questions of most concern to you .
should a muslim in a mosque or a town hall marry ( or both ) ?
young muslims should be lectured on evolution and rights of homosexuals ?
can a muslim mrs her marry a non- muslim man ?
it is for a muslim permissible to use an interest - oriented banking system , in order to get a mortgage ?
it is these seemingly mundane affairs gives , he claims , the daily life , in contrast to the political drama , the media .
the author , a new generation of imams acknowledges , teachers and intellectuals , none of them with a well - known names , possibly with the exception of tarik ramadan , a muslim - arab scholars who was born in switzerland and professionals .
this new generation trying to open up the debate on this , as it is possible , on the one hand , a good muslim and , on the other hand , a good citizens to be in a modern secular society .
they have not all arguments on their side .
conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a french or european islam .
questioned the thinkers and activists who bowen , with their salafi counterparts are usually divided – advocates of puristischen sunni islam , which in connection with saudi arabia is – the nowadays a small but influential presence among europe 's muslims show .
bowen is of the opinion that muslim values could be compatible and french secularism .
however , a convention requires a give and take on both sides .
he queries to what extent are french policymakers ( and the intellectual elite , the so passionate the separation of church and state guarded ) really feel committed to pluralism .
he suggests that muslims may receive rougher treatment than catholics , protestants , jews , who had to make their historic compromise with the secular republicanism .
he recognizes a " tightening the screws of values " rather than a growing pragmatism .
islam can be french ? in the aftermath of the read this paper , it is inclined to say ' yes , but not yet ' .

ironically , in the waters of the north of those two hunting nations the ice the longest remain .

anti- government graffiti and statements are regarded as a serious crime .
cuba has a growing bloggers community , which will be led by the popular reporter yoani sánchez , the often describes how she and her husband and be pursued and attacked by government representatives .
sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country , in order to receive prices , but this has always been rejected .
the arrest of an american contractor is probably the tensions between the government of the castro communist brother in cuba and the obama administration increase , a " slow " proximity to the improvement of relations with the island had sought .
the news of the arrest of the new york times reported was first last friday night .
attaches importance to the new us policy will provide a contribution in the united states , if the cuban government took concrete steps in this direction , as release political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition .
mobile phones and notebooks are in cuba legally , even though you are new and coveted products in a country , in which the average earnings of an government officials $ 15 per month .
since this year , the cuban government only allowed normal citizens the purchase of a mobile phone , they are mainly used for the dispatch of text messages , because a 15 - minute telephone conversation a daily wage costs would .

pakistani government representatives cover plan , to send men to afghanistan

the case of the five men - which are still in pakistan and be consulted by the fbi - underlines the vital role of recruitment agencies in the identification of future terrorists and possibly even more importantly , in the decision , who is trustworthy .
since the attacks of 11 september 2001 , the us secret services to a matter of the utmost urgency , made human asset within of al qaeda .
recruiters act as guardians of organisation , which will not let the people , whose commitment for the holy war is not seriously enough and that , this could be the spies .

this is part of the reasons why i have decided to participate in the large demonstration - the floor in order to pass and to appeal to the world leader , to bring about a fair , ambitious and binding agreement , she said .
it is not an easy task , but it must be done now and there is no way leads more , the around it .
the thought police the demonstrators from close to the bella centre and said that you should have been 19 people arrested , mainly due to the fact that they were either hooded or pocket knife mitführten .

test data show persistent racial divide
performance were welcome last week the certificates to mathematics good news for the public schools in washington d.c.
although the district washington is still far behind the schools of the country , the excellence produce the evidence to show that the fourth and achtklässler faster progress than towns in the last two years , the atlanta , chicago and include new york , have made .
but what in the latest figures from the national evaluation of the educational progress ( national assessment of educational programme - naep ) is included , is the persistently performance gap between african - american and white pupils , both at local , and national level .
point of the average number of white viertklässler from washington d.c. rose in the last two years of 262 to 270 ( on a range of 500 ) , the their african - american counterparts , but only three points rose from 209 to 212 .
output gap between 2007 and 2009 , in reality , which rose from 53 to 58 points .
the progress of the african - american basically remained constant achtklässler , it fell by a statistically significant point from 245 to 244 .
average number of point white pupils was not included in the test data , since the sample size was not big enough .
the picture of a six - year period is also not encouraging .
separated the gap , the white and black viertklässler 2003 , when the first naep was recorded in this district , fraud 60 scale points ( 262 to 202 ) .
and although the number of point that children have achieved both groups , has grown in this period , has barely narrowed the difference with now 58 points .
some educational supporters of the southern district last week expressed their concern that the results of school chancellor michelle example rhee and the democratic mayor adrian m. fenty was celebrated , the largest part of white pupils , who are already strong children , were driven forward .
this intimates that we the overall value judgement by the treatment of those who have raised at the top end of the scale , which is complicated and difficult , jeff smith said , a member of the board of the dc voice , a nonprofit group for the equality of education in washington d.c. entry .
i will not for a range of two or three points on and , said the democratic washington councillor member , kwame a daughter , in the fourth r. brown , who has the eaton primary school classes .
brown , a frequent critics of the management style of rhee , said , the message of the examination figures point is that the secondary schools by the city need urgent attention .
naturally , there is always a would like to see the positive signs , i respect that .
what frightens me , however , is that we not spend nearly the time and energy , using the funds we for our school should .
rhee said , the district must continue , to find better ways to be in order to meet the needs of the weak - achieving pupils .
in this autumn , for example , some will teachers , trained in a new read curriculum , the wilson - read - system , to use , the pupils in the upper classes of the primary school and resources aimed at school , what basic skills of reading not at the start of their school have mastered career and the significantly behind their peers classmates .
everyday mathematics , a curriculum , from nursery school to the sixth class games and real - life experience in the centre stage , was under the former senior school inspector clifford janey according to washington and this curriculum will be some of the naep - progress , which have been attributed to , reported last week .
i believe that we must continue to work , the best measures to benefit the pupils , are under the central level , rhee said .
others say that the naep highlight - results of the question whether rhee can continue to do so , to improve the overall performance of the system and will continue to the additional money and the resources can be made available for the performance of weak schools , which are necessary , in order to reduce the gap .
this is a serious dilemma for michelle rhee , bruce fuller said , a professor of education at the university of california at berkeley , the urban audit findings investigated .
is the conventional cure , and its resources management reforms at schools , which are in the poorest areas of washington , dc .
the objective could create political aftermath , the work to this important item .
the weak point is of course , as in other urban school inspectors that they are trying to white and black middle class to keep .
our focus is to ensure that we build a great schools system .
we must strengthen our schools in the city areas , so that every family , irrespective of where they live , can be sure that their children an excellent public education can receive .
janey , the now school inspector in newark , is , in an interview this week said that one of the most important elements to the closure of the output gap is , the traditional public school , and at the moment that in washington 180 days is to extend , in order to compete with the charter schools .
we must increase the school year to nearly 200 next , in order to have the power to change , janey said , with its teachers trade union last year to an agreement on 185 days per year , the he as " a milestone ' on the road to a greater increase in the next treaty .
university education for more people than future prospect
achieved the coach the gettysburg college , with a resounding pipe .
graciela rodriguez , 12 , rising from and blinzelt a moment at the sight of the white pillars , namely the brick walls and of the ' emerald greens lawn . '
gracielas parents have the scrappy high school concluded in el salvador .
until recently had also graciela , which has been recovered in silvermines spring and now live in river allendale , never set foot in a college campuses .
its attitude and the other achtklässler of the group , to explore the gettysburg where the teaching costs usd 38.690 per year , was the full of reverence visitor , rather than the one enthusiastic future students .
' yes ! here , i will soon be ! ' , called graciela , who would like to study medicine , as the leader announced that they had now for natural sciences enter the building .
wow , really ? " " they said food for thought , as the low professor - to - school students ratio was reported .
the college in pennsylvania was the 7 that have visited on their three - day tour of the child and now they have the desired message : the question is not included in full , whether we are going to the college .
the question is where .
on the one hand , there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the united states hispanischer immigrants , what the high school not end or as a teenager become pregnant , but also on the other hand , there are hundreds of thousands , what the college , which is necessary in order to receive training in the middle class levels .
in truth , one of five of these ' second generation ' of the college hispanics americans – what is a remarkable achievement , since many of your immigrant parents , mainly came from mexico or in central america , in the united states , without the high school have finished .
your success stories are important , researchers , because they say for a generation that has a huge role in the labour forces in the country will play , show the way forward .
assess , the powerful children , those who say that this very often have a natural affinity for school and inherent in them a boost to success .
many of you have also parents to set high targets , for their children and to find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with american schools .
but advice programmes also play a major role , by they graciela and millions of children as they help , to come in college , especially if these efforts on a longer time continue .
if we regarded low - income children whose parents have not the experience and skills , to help them in the search for a way through the system , we will then have a single measure at any time does not solve the problem , patricia gándara said , a researcher at the university of california , davis , and the hispanic american students examined .
we must consider , for these children a supportive network of pre- school up by the high school to make available .
the federal programme had financed tour gracielas college , is a useful example .
it is known as implement up a gear - and , more than $ 300 million per year available for local school systems , in order to launch college - preparatory work programmes , the start , if low - income school pupils in the funds are , and to continue until you have completed the high school .
according to the us department for education , the programme has helped more than 10 million pupils since 1999 , 60 % of whom more than in college gone .

in iran are no good opportunities for election , he said in response to the question of soldiers the likelihood of such a development .
' one of the things that are on the soul to me , is that if we in the last six years have learned something from iraq , the war own unpredictability . "

iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should be won only for peaceful purposes .
during the talks in geneva on 1 october , iran said that he would reintroduce the talks on the restriction of its nuclear programme and to an essential part of its camps stock of depleted uranium in exchange for much - needed would forgo nuclear fuel for his medical research reactor .
the us government has pushed for this type of agreement in order to build confidence between the two parties and time for negotiations to gain .
iran seems but since this time the negotiations have to rely on the provisional agreement -- partly , experts say , because the iranian leadership is split over whether they should commit themselves to the united states .
iran that the international community in relation to a number of proposals to which they had already been agreed in early october , has left simply , has , frankly , the international community , including the russians and chinese , in a way , as it brought together in connection with important additional sanctions for iran have never been , gates said .

tensions between the kurds and the arab majority in the iraq are still high , in particular in relation to borders , property rights , and because the distribution of public revenues .
gates urged both sides , to reduce the potential for conflict , in order to prevent delays in the us plans , the american troops , up until the end of august of 115 000 to 50 , 000 to reduce .
gates also sought , the kurdish concern on the forthcoming a withdrawal of troops to dispel . to the us representatives quoted gates , masood barzani , president of the kurdish regional government , saying : ' we will their security , prosperity and their autonomy within a united iraq .

a change of direction in the ageing china
wang weijia and her husband grew surrounded by propaganda posters , considered that the lecture them , that is too tired in the ' mother earth , in order to maintain ' and ' a further children baby more means a grave more ' .
these lessons have you learned is that , so well than government officials in shanghai , the by the low birth rate and the ageing population in this summer suddenly began , to change course and young couples ermunterten , more than to have a child , their immediate answer and definitively was : ' in no case ' .
we have already invested all of our time and energy in a child .
said is nothing left for a second child , wang , 31 , a staff head with a 8 - month old son .
more than 30 years following the introduction of the one- child policy in china , the two generations of notoriously dicklichen , verzogenen individual children , the affectionately be called ' small emperor ' , has produced a population crisis in the country .
the average birth rate is to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 , at the time fallen entered into force , this policy , the un
department for population issues , while the number of 60 years and the ageing population group in the year 2020 by 16.7 % of the population to 31,1 % by the year 2050 will increase exponentially . this is far above the global average of around 20 % .
this imbalance is in rich coastal cities with educated population , like shanghai , more .
last year have 60 - year - olds and older almost 22 % of the reported residents shanghai , identified , while the birth rate under a child - per - couple has been .
zhenhua lingli , leader of the shanghai city demographic and family planning commission has said that couples get normal reproductive age babies must , in order to help ' , the relationship to reduce the ageing population shares and the shortage of manpower to alleviate the future . "
shanghai will soon ' -- but not so rich -- as old as the industrialised countries , such as japan and sweden , be , ' she said .
a gradual easing
enshrined in the country 's constitution in 1978 , china 's one- child policy will probably be the most controversial disposal , which was introduced by the ruling communist party until today .
couples , the breach of this policy , must reckon with huge fines -- up to its triple annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination in their work .
chinese state representatives have attributed to this policy is that the critical demands of natural resources country could be avoided , while representatives of human rights abuses in the enforcement of the policy have condemned .
in rural regions have some officials pregnant women , who already has a child were forced to abortion .
couples had also implement gender selective abortion , causing a unnatural balance of women to men .
over the past few years , government representatives for population gradually moderated their position on the one- child policy .
2004 , they have allowed for more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers , members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife individual children have been -- and 2007 was the tone many hard moderated slogans .
qiao xiaochun , a professor at the university for population research institute beijing said that government representatives recently even discussed more radical changes have , for example , couples to allow two children , where a partner individual child is .
shanghai was in july to the first chinese city , the launched an aggressive campaign to promote more birth .
posters , the family belehrten , only to have a child , were replaced almost overnight of directives , which describe in detail , who for a second child question is and how we can apply for authorisation .
has the city administration urban employees and volunteers for family planning sent to go and see couples at home and data sheets under the doors to blame .
you also asked , psychological and financial advice for the available to , the more than have a child .
encouraging the response was not just said , family planning representatives .
disappointing response
although from a rural town in the foreign areas officials from shanghai said , that a recovery in the applications from couples to recognise is that after the launch of the campaign a second child , the urban districts against this report does not want to change .
in the municipality huinan with a population of 115 000 are still per month as an example only four to five requests .
disillusioned shanghai officials say that the expected for 2010 number of births in the city still despite the campaign in approximately 165,000 will be -- slightly higher than 2009 , but lower than in 2008 .
feng juying , leader of the family planning committee of the shanghai community caolu , said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people are no longer want to have children .
they want to give her first the best , she said .
yang jiawei , 27 , and his wife , liu juan juan , 26 , said that they would like to have two children , and this is also legally allowed .
but they have , as many chinese , only a minor health and life insurance by the government .
without a social network , they say , this decision would be irresponsible .
people in the west assess the one- child policy falsely as a question of human rights , said yang , a civil engineer , his wife in the seventh month with their first child is pregnant .
indeed , it is robbing us the opportunity to have more than a child .
but the problem is not simply in a policy .
the problem is money .
other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitate .
wang , leader of the staff , said that you would just like to a child , because it was also an individual child ' . we were the centre of the family and used , that everyone has has dealt with us .
we are not accustomed to us to care for others and did not really want this . '
chen zijian , a 42 -year-old , a translation companies , the said it plain .
for parents from the medium- sized enterprises with double career , by the birth rate is falling , he said , it is a matter to be a success and that means we must be selfish .
the the today , 20 - 39 - year - olds age group , so that grew to their parents during the early days of the chinese capitalism experiment fight and they want to see such a life for themselves , if not he said .
also , a single child he said , makes huge demands to the time of parents .
a mother must abandon their social life for at least two years .
then there is the area question -- " we must rebuild its housing ' -- and the planning of life -- " if the child 9 months old , it is already have a curriculum vitae able to the best nursery schools ' .
most of his friends are prepared , to make this a time , chen said , but not twice .
our generation is the first , which has achieved a higher standard of living and he said .
we want not too many sacrifices .
un group devises plan to reduce emissions
the fed by the un climate conference -- which up to now characterised by wild poznań and recrimination -- has on friday , publication of a document again a priority , for the next 40 years of recording an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas emissions , and the industrial nations in the near future the greatest burden shoulders to .
the text , the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases could deliver , has displayed both the remaining obstacles , as also shown the way forward .
but he was seen as an important progress in a negotiated , the time comes , because next week than 100 leaders from all over the world will arrive in copenhagen .
the text , the un working group established by a specific was formulated , is silent on the quantity of money from the rich countries to the poor , countries that should be so that these short and long term can meet the global warming .
he also offers a range of options for the key issues , including such as industry and large emerging countries can restrict their carbon - emitting and how high the upper limit for the global temperature increase should be , the political decision - makers would support .
the process will be given a great deal of flexibility , as john coequyt , a senior representative of the sierra clubs in washington .
michael zammit cutajar , the six - page document has drafted , has summed up a negotiating text 180 pages in order to make the in the centre of what the representative of the leading climate protection of the un , ivo de boer , described as " the great whole ' .
it shows the fundamental plans for a possible agreement , in which the industrial nations together their emissions by 25 % to 45 per cent by 2020 , compared with the limit values in 1990 , would reduce their emissions in the same period , while major developing countries would reduce by 15 % to 30 % .
together , the countries could reduce the emissions by 50 % and 95 % by 2050 .
moreover , the european community has the talks on friday a boost by your assurance given , over the next three years to provide $ 3.6 billion per year , in order to help poorer countries , adapt to the effects of climate change - from the champions of flooding and droughts to avoiding deforestation .
the friday , nevertheless , the same verbal pyrotechnics the discussions in the last week had intended .
the american climate - change special envoy todd stern began has wordings rejected , the binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in industrialised countries , compared with voluntary reductions for greater demand emerging countries , if this not be financed by the industrial nations .
announced that this train the obama government a tougher line with china , as representative of the bush government is not even two years ago .
sign the united states are no agreements , without any significant emerging countries stand up and take action , so star also lamented the fact that the text does not go far enough , to ensure that the reductions also outside it could be confirmed .
stern , its opinion was a time after the statement by the chinese deputy foreign minister he yafei , which stated that it was the leading american climate negotiators either lacks ' of common sense ' or ' it was highly irresponsible " of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the united states would not financially assist china to meet the global warming .
by the fact that the future economic direction of the world 's major powers at stake , have , both within the industrial nations , as well as between the industrial nations and the fault lines emerging countries opened up .
equally , the current fight relates to the rescue of individual economies , as well as to the rescue of the planet , and china and the united states , which , because of their respective commitments squabbles , while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps .
ricardo ulate , a delegate from costa rica , said that it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting , who should bear the costs for the bremsung greenhouse gas emissions , because even the countries affected have begun to proceed , aggressive in making , the countries with very high greenhouse gas levy to account for their actions .
it is clear that this is a game , implying will develop new economic domination , so ulate , also as a regional climate change advisers for conservation internationally in mexico and central america is active .
some of the countries that are most exposed to the effects of climate change , said that they would continue to fight on a legally binding agreement in copenhagen , although the leading participants to say that the discussions in the best - case scenario will lead to a political agreement .
the alliance of small island states with 43 members , early on friday morning has produced a 24 - page draft treaty .
artur until - butcher , the leading the international climate negotiations for the european commission , said that the offensive of small island states ' political pressure on the whole political process , " partly because they are now united and measures of the emerging countries , such as china , india , and demand .
the talks , got a new urgency , as the delegates have focused on the fact that most of the open questions still to the arrival of the government leaders must be clarified , in order to come to an agreement .
high - level representatives , as the indian environment minister , jairam ramesh , and the chinese vice - minister entstiegen their aircraft and around by the corridors of bella centre to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to claims posts , which will be negotiated during the next week .
the sheer scale of the assembly -- 13,000 people go on a daily basis in congress centre and from activists , gitarre match organise late - night shows , in which it is about making fun of the countries , which is your opinion , betrayed and sell , and draft treaty will be passed on hand to hand rather than by e-mail -- is already a challenge .
builds the intensity just on that almost all the important ministers are here , and from wednesday 60 government leaders will be in copenhagen .
we shall now proceed to the oberliga , said carlos manuel rodriguez , vice - president for global policy of organisation conservation internationally .

britain 's first 225 km / h faster train defines the monday feeling new
monday morning at 5 o'clock 13 will be a pipe permeate the darkness , in order to announce a train departure , which represents a revolution in transport in the united kingdom .
the first high - speed commuter train in the country is in its lightning journey from ashfort , kent , after the london st pancras 225 km / h achieve and 93 km in 38 minutes .
to lord adonis , the transport ministers , will then lady kelly holmes on board the first javelin - commuter services from london .
he hopes , that the new service britain finally to an international rail network quicker , more reliable trains will ankoppeln and the large urban areas the midland region , and of the north of scotland in london will bind .
the neglected province could be to living commuter cities , labour meps hours would radically reduced and the exchange of aircraft and car on rail would the national carbon emissions and reduce congestion on the roads .
believe the three large parties in theory this vision .
but the british pound , the many billion are necessary for the construction of a new national rail network , the inevitable planning slaughter and fears of environmental damage in the british high - speed of tracks could still applying the brakes .
high speed two ( hs2 ) , a company based in january , and that the government is to present a viability study , will lord adonis according to the times deliver the report on 30 december .
this would give it a detailed routes card of the next stage of the high - speed rail network .
the new railway line , the london is to link with the west midlands , is with a margin of five metres in urban areas and pass in places , where the impact on the environment are controversial .
on the free premises will the plan the concept within a gap of 25 metres from the final route show .
hs2 should also three options for a greater , northwards leading produce high - speed rail network .
lord adonis will respond in the spring .
proposed the preferred option is a y - shaped routing , in which a single high - speed link would lead to the west midlands .
the route would are in , or in the vicinity of birmingham parts and a abzweig would lead western pennines to manchester and scotland and another in the direction of north - east after sheffield , leeds and newcastle - upon tyne .
a single line would lead to scotland .
" it appears to be the most effective option , " a rail insider said .
after the completion of the travel time would be between london and edinburgh on 2 hours 40 minutes reduce .
the first part of the route which would not be opened up in 2025 , would allow the travellers , the london - birmingham route in 49 minutes today , compared with just over one hour , to go .
draft the offer the trains , with a speed of the possibility to travel 400 km / h , which the british rail network the quickest europe would .
the first line has been planned in such a way as to 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1.100 people who insist able to travel .
up to 18 trains per hour on the london - route birmingham could be in operation .
again , this would mean that in london a terminus station would be necessary , on the 20,000 travellers per hour - could be .
given the spatial restrictions in the capital is expected that a existing station would be extended to the high - speed network .
rail experts say that only st pancras internationally or euston have this potential .
lord adonis will be aware , whether or not this plan its opinion should be continued , but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken only after the parliament elections .
but if he is the wheels in motion , that in sections of the network must be built .
trains should first of the high - speed lines to existing rail routes in the north of birmingham change , which the travel time between london and scotland would continue to lie in over three hours .
this is a crucial sticking point , so that a shift from air to rail can be ensured , a beacon for the rail revolution .

"
protest has an activist than in duncans lawn a hole in the form of a £ label dug , after it became known that he over three years gbp 4000 ( eur 4 500 ) had demanded .
last night , when he was asked about the increased mortgage , duncan : " this was said by both the fees office , and which subsequently legg to increase value has been approved . "

hervé morin announcing publicly his intention to , to take this udf labelling , since he is the opinion that françois bayrou not worthy would be to defend this political legacy , after he had a hand to the left .
of the defence ministers , whose party partners the ump is , incidentally , wanted to this strategy on saturday before the national council of the nc to reaffirm .
the strength of his efforts he had the support of the members mr hervé de charette ( former ump , now in received nc ) , the right to the property of the brand udf , since it firstly that these branded 2004 as the ' institute national de la propriété industrial ' has requested .
however , the secretariat of the collapsed by françois bayrou 's friends supervised parties alliance udf , led the silence and clearly gave us to understand that they are not expropriate left , and the minister and the honourable member under threat of a judicial persecution a deadline , this labelling not to use more and their to be transferred to the property rights of the trademark .
over the past few days , you have made many statements that they their political movement would propose that the udf siegelzu take + + , wrote the alliance of the political parties in a letter signed , 19 of the 24 office members , including françois bayrou and mrs de sarnez , of the modem party and the senator jean arthuis of centrist alliance .

but also ordered the 15 criminal a medical examination of the 87 -year-old liliane beds court , which will be performed jointly by three doctors .
the heir and main shareholder of l'oréal has so far refused to undergo such a study , especially not in the , during the investigation of the state prosecutor of nanterre presented conditions .
appointed the on friday doctors should produce a report before the 10 march 2010 , in which they give clear known as to whether and to what times liliane beds court in a state of weakness can have considered .
i think that it will be subject to these investigations .
i will talk to it , the lawyer said by mrs beds court , me georges kiejman , after the negotiation .
what the lawyer of françoise beds court - meyers , me olivier metzner is concerned , it is very satisfied with the decision of the court of justice .
this is an excellent piece of news ( ... ) . the report will prove that he ( banier ) has this old lady manipulated , which must be protected , confirmed it .

managers - revolution , or at the end of the strategic early information ?
if nothing changes in the governance of the great french companies , our fight for the development of the economic intelligence ... in vain
for more than a decade , the attitude of the management of large companies in terms of its staff , the position of the said companies vis-à-vis the consumer before the marketing revolution : it is the best intended for the personnel join ' values ' , as it was on the consumer products from the technicians in the work designed to impose .
by you to customers in the heart of the company has the marketing revolution the strategies of the reconquest of markets in the place given ... although the authoritarian temptation products separately factors preferences of customers to impose regularly again !
demobilisation of staff can lead to a lethal demoralisation .
the suicides in france telecom , psa or renault are only the tip of a much wider phenomenon , which , in particular , the employees affected .
these demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company from , in particular those of r & eund , what is even more crucial to those of the economic intelligence .
in fact calls for the iu ( intelligence economique = economic intelligence ) ' of all the parties involved ( ... ) the proactive and a future - oriented vision ' ; it claims by the staff a use , the instructions of the authoritarian management entirely disagree with .
this is why we are calling for a occupational revolution , which would involve , the staff in denmittel point of the concerns expressed by the company equal to the customers .
use the very - related internal opinion polls
will the internal surveys of public opinion , as the questionnaire , the orange has presented its wage earners , this revolution in relation to the management practice suggest ?
unfortunately , i fear not .
- firstly , because i was able to establish that the entire structure with a new situation in the end after many deviations priority concerned , to do this , ... what it always has done .
also because the authoritarianism , one of the pathology of power - proportional to the importance of his own failures is increasing .
and finally , because most have executives a simplistic idea of human behavior .
emerged from the large engineering schools is their mechanistic interpretation psychology .
they take by intellectuals comfort the old behaviori tables theory , the recently from the american " neurosciences ' reactivated and unwittingly far - reaching of scientific and research institutes and has been spread by the media .
thus and by you suggested that it is possible , the " leverage " ( sic ) to the commitment of employees to work , encouraged a survey published aktuellein le figaro.fr of ipsos the executives in a position to a mechanistic management system , which is not suitable for today 's world .
mobilisation of the factors identify and measure
instead , requires a for the smooth functioning of the modern business necessary occupational revolution , the adoption of a final view of human behavior .
it is , in any idea or practice of managing a fundamental minutes to integrate : for the wage - earners is the commitment for the company only possible if it clearly seems as a means to a part of their dreams , their ambition to implement and their projects .
moment , take only the studies from the multi- functional analysis , this conception of the motivation of the staff .
these studies have shown that they doxa laid down their businesses at the basis of a judge , the you by your perceived picture of the company allowed to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals .
thanks to the mobilisation of identification and of the measurement of these factors , the leadership of the companies can control their " social - welfare benefits , predict and pre- empt and their human resource management again at the right place .
so they create a fertile ground for the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence is favourable .
oslo the speech : the " fair " war brings obama praise from law a
barack obama 's american rights has , on friday , on the eve in oslo speech welcomes and was satisfied that the nobel peace prize 2009 the notion of ' fair war ' against the enemies of the united states has defended .
conservatives , the distribution of the prize to obama on 9 october mocked had , applauded this time the president - in- office 's speech , the example of the former vice - presidential candidate in the elections of 2008 sarah palin following .
i liked what he said , palin said , the face of the right - wing of the republican party in the newspaper us today and added that they sometimes even the subject of a " necessary " war in their has just been published memoirs have raised .
the war is , of course , the last , of which i think that the americans want to do it , but it is necessary .
we must stop the terrorists down there , it says .
obama , the two wars has inherited from its predecessors , george w. bush , the iraq and wars in afghanistan , on thursday in oslo has endeavoured to justify the use of violence ; a way , to explain his entscheidungvon nine days ago , 30 000 additional to send troops to afghanistan .
newt gingrich , a other opponents of obama , was of the opinion , the präsdent have done a very good job in oslo ' ' .
i was really very well that the speech was , frohlockte the former president of the house of representatives , in particular the reference to ' the existence of the evil in the world ' in obama 's words recognised .
in some parts habeich this speech and completely perceived as historic , declared gin rich , the in the radio programme was questioned about " the take away ' .
the previous members , by some as a potential candidate for the republican nomination to the 2012 presidential election will be seen , said he was pleased to have seen a ' president of the left ' , reminded of the members of the nobel committee that they were not free " and a price for the peace could not send if the use of violence would not exist ' .
to michael gerson , former recorder from george w. bush , and now editor in the washington post , obama has " a very american " speech .
in addition to the fact that he presents itself as the ' kosmopolit ' , such as ' he always power , " he ' as an american president has spoken , " when he pointed out that the europeans ' as live in a security bubble , which they have not created themselves and for their protection not do a lot , " so gerson .
among the few , not staunch called rights of the former un ambassador john bolton , a hawk the bush - era , the speech at the site of the national review online as " boring , highfalutin and inspiration happening " .
on the left of the president shows the democratic representative dennis kucinich worried , as barack obama defended the recourse to the armed forces .
packaged it the war under the guise of justice , the massacre of the innocent quite simply justify he warns that .
extols the press the center - left , however , remains on the side of the president .
the los angeles times , which is still believe that the nobel peace prize was premature awarded to obama , referred to the speech itself for a speaker like him , known for his talent is , as ' monumental work ' .
the speech in oslo ' provides a timetable plan to the management of international decisions against the conflicts , poverty and the repression ' , so the california newspaper enthusiastic .
the new york times is of the opinion that obama " the necessary discourse proclaimed " and called his speech as " bleak and exemplary at the same time ' .

the conflict ' could have been very much damage to the companies ' and ' it was to be feared that he would affect the festive season at the end of the year ' , so bussereau .
the agreement provides for a wage increase of 4 % for the lowest wages ( local and regional road transport ) and by 2.9 % for the highest - paid groups ( international transport ) .
sentence the hours for workers with the lowest wages is rising of 8,72 to eur 9,06 .
" it is not particularly much , but we are all to small first ' , so starting patrice clos ( fo ) .
instructed the activists are now , the supply depots no longer to block .
" but it is likely to always be some recalcitrant , which are not satisfied with the agreement , " he supplemented .
chairman of the tlf - philippe grillot spoke of a " good agreement ' , even though it was ' difficult , these salary increases allow in the face of international competition " .
according to him , is the increase in eur 170 per month for the low and eur 100 and 120 for the high wage groups .
' this agreement is based on the common sense and respect for the employees ' , so maxim dumont ( cfdt ) , while thierry douine ( cftc ) spoke of ' an historic agreement ' .
richard jaubert ( cgt ) spoke on this ' an acceptable compromise ' .
the agreement is also an increase in the travel costs to 3 % , and the upholding of the overall budget for the road transport in the first half of the year 2010 , which will enable it , in particular , the subject and the 13 month 's salary modernisation of collective agreements to tackle .
m. bussereau reminded us that for the employers ' the fall of the contributions to the tune of eur 100 million ' subject for an amendment by the government on the draft law by the corrected finances for 2009 was , in the night was adopted by the national assembly on thursday .
the government is calling for ' an identical ' vote by the senate .
the signature of the first tlf allows that the agreement applies to the companies associated with this organisation , and that they then in the event of an extension of the union by the labour minister for the whole profession applies .
this will be the case ' in the shortest possible time ' , assured bussereau .
the opposition of the employers ' associations can only delay the procedure .
the association fntr published a " fraudulent trading ' , because , according to the 100 million euro ' were the sector to offset part of the carbon tax has already been promised ' .
secretary of state for transport forced us to negotiate , as soon as possible , but not on the basis of a common analysis , but to the goose - mouth to feed to the approaching christmas days not to disgruntling , laments the unostra .
for the association otre threatens the agreement ' the small and medium- sized enterprises in this sector of industry in the next 12 months to dig a large tomb ' .

furthermore , the judges the waiver of parliamentary immunity , announced the türk and tugluk enjoy , as well as the confiscation of goods of the party .
the dtp in parliament ( now has 21 seats of 550 ) .
the party leaders have spoken before the verdict to the effect that the parliamentarians parliament would rather leave than as party unemployed to meet parliamentarians .
followed a the decision in the year 2007 by the prosecutor of the turkish federal court abdurrahman yalçinkaya initiated procedures . he accused the dtp , the " instructions " to follow the kurdistan workers ' party ( pkk ) , the ankara and many other countries will be regarded as a terrorist organisation .
many observers believe that the dtp is the legal political showcase the pkk - rebels .
assured the party , " no ' to have the pkk link , but refuses to call this as a terrorist organisation and calls upon the government to negotiations on .
computer the government between the verdict of the constitutional court , which seeks to accommodate the kurdish community and a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the kurds to propose in order to achieve the support of the pkk by the kurds everything dry up and to end the conflict .
the leader of the dtp confirm that any dissolution to a resurgence of could generate tensions in south - eastern anatolia , where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention in the past few weeks , of the heads of pkk , abdullah öçalan led to clashes with the police .
since the announcement of the court of thousands of demonstrators gathered before the premises million of the dtp in the city of diyarbakir in the south - east , which has largely populated by kurds .
the order forces firing tear - gas grenades and water cannons , when the demonstrators began , molotov cocktails and throwing stones to .
hundreds of people also demonstrated in istanbul .
türk , once the ruling , assumed that the decision of the court ' will continue to deepen the despair ' .
' turkey can this ( kurdish , anm. that editorial ) question not on the basis of the ban a party clarify , " he told of the press .
the government , consisting of a party , which has emerged from the islamist movement , regretted the decision also .
" we oppose on principle against the closure of the parties .
that does not solve the problems , " as energy minister taner yildiz .
' this decision is a torpedoing of the opening of democratic , which was promoted by the government , " the political market observers ahmet island .
" you can appears to be a response ' the pkk , adds it .
known the pkk to an attack on thursday , in the three days earlier seven soldiers have died in the north of turkey . it was one of the most brutal attacks in the last months .
collapse of the snow can come
a properly knackigen winter , that is what is brewing burger wolfgang wishes .
not because he wants to bully the citizen , says the winter head the fes .
but , so that its staff the whole of the vehicle try and master technology can learn .
at the weekend might be so far for the first time it according to meteorology .
330 staff and more than 120 vehicles will be available in order to be able to take care of snow and ice .
this is the fes after a precise plan .
snow as soon as it across the board in frankfurt and the sub - zero temperatures , be travelled 20 faithful to the so-called a - routes with large vehicles , brewing burger explained to us .
this includes , for example , main transport - and transit roads as the new way and the hanauer country roads .
but also fire access , public local passenger transport routes , pedestrianisation and routes with gap , such as the atzelberg road .
the service of the fes begins at three o'clock in the morning
the around 1040 kilometres , in needs in a maximum of three hours with wet salt responsible , the better , being disseminated .
therefore the fes starts three o'clock at night , " so that the sea are free , until the professional transport starts ' .
difficult will , if it was snowing . until 7.30 p.m.
then we have a problem , as the winter head says , " because no one then , the distribution of vehicles is prepared to make room ' .
afterwards , and so it is not further snowing , are feeder and developers roads , including the council - beil - road , in the number .
have the final priority sides - and in addition to roads .
brewing burger know where it will be complaints .
at five o'clock in the morning is the odds in order to the fes foot soldiers of the way , risks are mainly points and crossings cleared .
to all of the cycle paths fes often could not care .
there is in frankfurt , a special services of 22 until 4.30 a.m. p.m. above all the brewing burger bridges in mind , says .
because there are to these fast glätte , is , as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees , which streuer .
this will also called by the police if need be .
the cradle of dinosaurs
tawa hallae saw from as many other carnivorous dinosaurs : the two metres long and 1.50 metres major animal verged on two strong behind legs , had a whole skull with sharp , gebogenen teeth , short poor with sickle claws and a long tail .
lived would have provided the kind of a few million years later , it would be nothing special .
but tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs sterling , nesbitt with this body characteristics , reports of the university of texas in austin and colleagues in the magazine science by thursday .
about 215 million years ago , the animal lived in today 's new mexico , which was then in a dry area of super - continent pangäa was the equator .
tawa opened a new window on the early evolution of dinosaurs , nesbitt says .
he shows us a lot about the relationships , the spread and the features of the early dinosaurs .
2006 , nesbitt and other paleontologist started with a excavation on the ghost in the north ranch new mexicos .
we have sometimes found a dozen dinosaurs in a day - bones , which is unprecedented for deposits from the day , reported team - member randall irmis by the utah museum of natural history .
some of the bone identified the researchers quickly as new .
in the course of the archaeological they played the remains of a total of five individuals .
fund confirmed theories on dino - early history
the name ' tawa ' comes from the hopi sun god - indians .
nesbitt for sterling it is an exceptional fund : ' dinosaurs fossils - from the day we are extremely rare , is usually only individual fragments . '
other dinosaurs - not necessarily experts share the enthusiasm .
this fund is not particularly spectacular , but he confirmed some theories on the early history of the dinosaurs , says about martin sander , from the university of bonn .
according to the current doctrine , the dinosaurs for the first time around 230 million years ago .
many of the oldest fossils but incomplete , which is why the allocation this ur - dinos is most controversial .
so , for example , the experts debating when the echsen in their three main lines of development aufspalteten : the carnivorous theropoden , to which later the tyrannosaurus committee , the velociraptor and also the birds , known as the ensure ' " long with vierbeinigen sauropoden and their relatives , and the plant - eating ornithischia ( bird basin saurier ) , which , for example the species triceratops and stegosaurus belonged .
nesbitt and after the analysis of his colleagues is tawa hallae an original theropode .
he is an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties on , nesbitt says .
at the skull from tawa hallae took the researchers , for example references to luftsäcke , as you also have the descendants of theropoden , the birds , .
thanks to the luftsäcke is the breathing of birds more effective than the mammals .
in tawa hallae were also the bones of the vertebral column apparently partly with air filled .
tawa is the oldest and greatest theropode with air bags , randall irmis says .
since the relatives of the line of huge sauropoden later also luftsäcke and lighter - bones , probably already was the common vorfahre both groups brought this useful innovation .
at least three migration waves after north america
because the dinosaurs primitive have known so far had lived in latin america , conclude the researchers that the echsen there appeared for the first time .
separated so early , the three lines of development and spread of south america on all continents from , which were still a super - continent pangäa formed one landmass .
speaking for the fact that , together with the team tawa hallae the remains of two further , not particularly closely related theropoden was .
can the three not of a common ancestor , immigrants , the researchers argue .
we believe that there were at least three waves of migration after north america , says alan turner by the american museum of natural history in new york , a co- author of the science study .
however , there are also contradictions .
an even older type , silesaurus , which forms part of a sister group the dinosaurs , lived in poland , the bonn paläontologe martin says sander today .
its opinion could be a distorted picture , because in latin america simply particularly many primitive dino - fossils are preserved , while in other continents hardly is something to be found .
as it created the dinosaurs , from a relatively rare to the sidelines of reptiles stock dominant country vertebrate animals of the earth middle ages to develop , is still puzzling .
during the day the dinosaurs divided their area still living with many other reptiles , for example with the ancestors of today 's crocodiles and the flugsaurier and with many other echsen .
towards the end of the day the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species , while the kinship on the border of the day the jura ausstarb .
success story was not going to last forever
there are two hypotheses in order to explain this change , says martin sander .
it could have given to die a mass , the dinosaurs happen to be survived , but the other reptiles not .
or the dinosaurs were better adapted , so that they could beat the competition from the field .
the success story was certainly not going to last forever .
150 million years later gave a meteorite impact of a group of animals to flourish , which are also already in the triassic entwickeltet had and since then a shadow general fristete : the mammals .
solidarity from vienna to são paulo
the list is long and the signatories are internationally .
toronto university professors are point , the university of cambridge , the standardisation vienna or from berkeley in california .
lecturers from naples are , from quebec , edinburgh , new york , são paulo or bremen , berlin .

legitimately expression of a growing concern about the protest is their own future , says mr verdi - country youth secretary alexander klein .
hessens science minister eva bold - hörmann ( cdu ) , however , the action of standardisation president and of police defended .
we are grateful to the standardisation president .
destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable resources , as you said in a current time on thursday in wiesbadener provincial .
we have understanding for the protest , but no understanding for vandalism , so the cdu - provincial members peter beuth .
saw the different groups spd , the opposition of the greens and the left .

new silicon - valley
long years it was considered secret city , for western visitors inaccessible .
selenograd , one of the capital ten districts moscow , in the soviet union was a tough location for secret defence research .
today , the community with their 216 000 inhabitants , 37 kilometres from the moscow centre , as " russian silicon valley ' .
significant research and production centres for micro - and nanoelectronics are here .
already since september 2008 , representatives had selenograds contacts to frankfurt science location riedberg linked - with the uni institutes and the firms of frankfurt innovation centre ( fiz ) .
there have been several mutual visits and on wednesday now signed selenograd and riedberg in frankfurt a " protocol on closer cooperation ' .
vice - moscow 's mayor yuri rosljak and prefect anatoly smirnov of selenograd led to the russian delegation , for frankfurt signed planning dezernent edwin black .
2010 will be representatives of the fiz and small and medium- sized enterprises in the natural scientific foschung focus for a seminar after selenograd travel .
scientific exchange
it is a continuous scientific exchange .
but it is also about economic relations .
firms of fiz will be possible , to gain a foothold in the growing russian market .
conversely , want to russian science firms contracts in germany acquire .
selenograd is the seat major russian research institutes and businesses .
for example , these include the moscow institute for electron technology , the big companies sitronics and rosssijskaja elektronika .
in 1958 , the community was a so-called " socialist plan city ' has been created for the defence research .
selenograd ( translates literally ' green city ' ) received his name from the forested hill landscape , in the research institutions are embedded .
stuttgart brake
the dimension of stuttgart 21 is not set high enough .
for the supporters of the project it is purely and simply in order to ' the new heart of europe ' .
rightly so . s21 is much more than the deeper lay a station , more than a monströses construction project , the city of baden - württemberg country capital for a decade will be in disarray works chaos .
stuttgart 21 arose from the spirit of the 1980 's .
capita stations with tracks , end up in the middle of the city , at that time were hailed as the transport of the 19th century and which technical fossils as constraints of a modern rail transport , a lot of time , as it once needed , locomotives from behind forward umzuspannen .
raking in , very briefly , go - go so should ´ s .
and that is why the head should stations disappear : in frankfurt and munich .
and in stuttgart : a station , for the sake of such as of passage route of the trans - european rail magistrale between paris / bratislava and budapest is - and this is why the slogan ' the heart of europe ' .
s21 will now actually tackled , although the visions of the 1980s , no longer are compatible with reality .
itself very ambitious planners have recognised that it is almost unaffordable in the hessischen and the bavarian city , the deeper implement .
capita stations do , however , also have no longer a and exit problem , since modern turning train drivers operating locomotives and trains tax dare at both ends .
nevertheless , stuttgart 21 along with the ice - new route after ulm section now will not addressed .
country - and local politicians have pushed it through .
power with the railways , also because the risks of the individual biggest infrastructure project of the republic of the taxpayers and not the state corporation contributes .
cities terms , the projects can be reasonably justify .
there is new city areas , which - believes we tables illustrating the planners generated the computer - will be equipped with a great deal of green .
rail is s21 harmful for the transport system .
development are the gateway station and the lines intended for the movement of persons , which we - typical 1980s - huge growth attributed .
at that time , there were not the competition from low - cost carriers .
modern transport policy but it must first of all , therefore , to strengthen the freight transport , as the transport by rail is very much more environment - friendly than by lorry on the road .
but the new route because intense climbs does not work for freight trains .
much still remains serious is that s21 indirectly affected also many other rail projects .
good eur six billion in schwäbischen verbuddelt be .
this is the official number .
experts 10 to 15 billion for realistic .
observation is , in the next decade will the money to other hubs and closely in the network lack .
as a whole sixty larger projects are on the list of the ministry of transport .
one of the most important is the extension of the good 180 kilometres long route through the rhine valley .
since 1987 will attend the route in the slow built .
were a matter of urgency , be reduced to the tube correctly here .
but s21 will act as a brake .
bottles of the rhine valley route will the neck for the international freight transport : in the middle of the heart of europe .
government is examining verdict on the airport
government has in the country wiesbadener provincial left open , whether they against the judgment of the hessischen administrative court of justice ( vgh ) to the ban on night flights in revision will go .
the cdu / german free democratic party ( fdp ) coalition experts have entrusted to the more than 400 pages vgh judgment legally examine , economy minister said , dieter posch ( fdp ) .
the vgh in kassel had on this next justified in writing that the country in the case of the construction of the north - west planned runway at frankfurt airport new rules to the ban on night flights .
the authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m. , as stipulated in the country government , is not with the legal protection of the population against noise at night offered to reconcile .
the coalition must decide until 4 january , whether it goes against the judgment in revision .
criticised the opposition to this desire for delays and the representatives of the government , for a revision in the federal administrative court in leipzig to renounce .
spd group chairman torsten schäfer - gümbel called on the cdu and the fdp to come back to their before the election promise made to return to a ban on night flights . otherwise it is as ' breach " to values .
it is hellishly difficult , if we must keep his word , greens said - head tarek al-wazir in an allusion to the german free democratic party ( fdp ) election slogan " we believe that word ' .
minister posch rejected the accusation by schäfer - gümbel , the country government attempts , with ' legal verdreherei and sleight of hand " but still to come to their night flights .
a precise legal examination need your time .
the coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a " rapid first impression ' .
we need a legal , safe entscheiung said stefan müller ( fdp ) .
so , as they constitute the opposition , would be the statements of his group , on the ban on night flights never have been .
us banks figures aid back
the us crisis - big banks strip their national shackles .
has the bank of america on wednesday the aid from the banks rescue fund tarp in a total of $ 45 billion ( a good eur 30 billion ) at a stroke repaid .

in june had already goldman sachs and jp morgan and morgan stanley repaid their aid .
rapid election
it was then but everything much faster than expected .
barely two weeks after the zdf board the president - in- office of the editor of santa claus brender from the office had urged , the station can present a successor .
wanted yesterday evening the body on the personalie vote .
was the favorite peter frey , director of the zdf - capital studios in berlin .
there was a confirmation from the sender , however , not - officially in order to anticipate the procedure not .
however , have also played a role , the zdf - controller markus schächter not to damage further , this proposal should also do not get through to the management board .
frey , schächters candidate , needs the support of nine out of 14 body members .
the outcome of the vote was not yet in print this edition .
two weeks ago , was schächter with his proposal , the treaty with nicholas brender failed to extend for a further five years , on the administrative board .
only seven members spoke for brender from , seven voted against him . brenders dismissal was a heavy defeat for schächter , a erwartbare however .
majority in the management board because the union had already signalled weeks before the election , brender not want to confirm in office .
had the organised resistance against the editor of the hessische prime minister roland koch .
with the argument , under brender , zdf news broadcasts would have to ratings lost , it rejected a further term of the highly respected journalist chief .
until shortly before the elections , it therefore protests , in which the political influence on the zdf was castigated .
least had even 35 state rights interfered in the debate , such as chefs those deemed unconstitutional 's action .
nothing came of it .
on the person
peter frey was born on 4 august in bingen in 1957 .
he studied policy , education and romanistik .
then he worked in the south - west radio and the frankfurter rundschau .
frey switched on zdf in 1983 , firstly on the ' today - journal ' .
subsequent stations : in 1988 to 1990 personal advisor of the chief journalist ; in 1991 / 92 correspondent in washington ; until 1998 head and moderator of the ' tomorrow magazine ' ; until 2001 head the zdf foreign policy ; since then director of the zdf - capital studios .
dismiss the greens , after the announced brenders , on wednesday , nor by the industries leaf medium magazine the journalists of the year was elected , a complaint of unconstitutionality lodged .
koch 's adversary in the management board , the rhineland pfälzische prime minister kurt beck declared , in the last week , the countries should change the zdf - state treaty , so that staff proposals of the controller cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority .
an extract of party leaders from the supervisory bodies of the zdf castle , however , also beck from .
brenders heir - apparent peter frey had recommended the management board with a wise move , by the body immediately after the brender - verts / ale group strongly criticised for that .
thanks to this belegs journalistic independence could it both schächter without loss of face for the post of chief journalist nominate as well as the management board choose , without come in the suspicion , a partisan do more to try to coax into office .
arithmetic will in the party frey already imputed to the liberal left - wing .
study will entrümpelt
part success for the students : after a year , the culture ministers of the countries of the education strike on thursday at last a : at a meeting of culture ministers - and university rectors ' conference , both sides agreed to the study to attempt to improve conditions in bachelor and master .
the students should be in the situation in the future , their studies also able to deal with .
they agreed to in detail , the verification to reduce burdens : each is intended in principle to study module only conclude with a single audit .
also to review the workload of the students will be guaranteed ' and ' a realistic and reasonable level .
policy and universities also want to the recognition of audit services between the universities within and outside germany simplify .
the countries committed themselves to targets for undergraduate and masters courses , common structure more flexible .
deviating countries rules in addition , it should not be .
less tests
since the beginning of the students protests in june bear rectors culture ministers and uni - the common dictum of better studierbarkeit in their mouths .
now it has been filled for the first time , with a specific content .
council decided the so-called accreditation , drastically to reduce the number of audits in part : ' every module closing in the rule with only a test , " it is said in a 30 - page document , the authorisation of study courses in part , newly is intended to regulate .
with the ' burden significantly reduce the test , " the accreditation council declared - chairman reinhold grimm 's fairy tale , should be a stop to ' drift , which significantly disrupted the studierbarkeit . "
should also be the ' studierbarkeit ' in future be ' in shaping the decisive criterion ' .
modules as content to examine are ' strict ' whether ' unnecessary einengungen the students in the election of the
events would prevent ' .
the students , " would be entitled to receive margins , the own - initiative allow and promote ' .
should apply the rules with regard to the approval of new , but also on the review of existing programmes .
this must all be five years of " reakkreditiert " – which means that it takes until 2015 before all courses have been reviewed .
responsibility for are national ten accreditation agencies , under the accreditation council established by the countries .
the culture ministers have had the countries in october ' with ' urges strongly to influence the agencies , so that the material abundance of not too big and the testing regime is not too strictly .
universities and colleges in individual länder , with the country ministries already agreed on the appropriate measures .
than hitherto single country said in rhineland - palatinate for the further development of the bologna process additional resources .
of the money is to establish the universities especially tutoren programmes and inspection and offices abroad to study guidance and strengthen .
country and spend universities want to make eur 10 million .
in early 2010 , the government wants to table an amendment of the academic law to the parliament .
after this for the conclusion of a study should be a single audit model only still needed .
shaping the study will be more flexible , also seeks to the recognition of performance prove to be guaranteed and facilitating the access to the master other universities .
by the end of next year courses of the country on their studierbarkeit everything should be checked .
government and opposition , on thursday had once again on the study conditions in the country argued .
alongside praise , but it also criticise the decisions .
the federal bureau of the juso - higher groups called for , the shaping of education policy should in future no longer ' behind closed doors ' the minister and university rectors take place .
at the latest , after the education strikes should now also the students ' affected have a say ' .
received support the future academics by the president of the university rectors ' conference ( hrk ) , margret winter umbrella : ' we need the experience of the students , " they said on thursday at a meeting with the culture ministers , with which the hrk on a common reform paper was discussed .
the trade union education and science ( forces ) the bonn process as a whole does not go far enough : it urges a legal entitlement , every graduates with an undergraduate degree the access to a further masters course allows .
on the other hand , the countries must ensure that for the current generation of undergraduate students tomorrow sufficient masters study places with the best possible study conditions available as forces board member andreas cellar .
countries must be clear the opportunity to recruit more lecturers .
to a freer access to the masters , but not the culture ministers .
more than a footnote to herta müller
respond in germany and from is beautiful ' almost no control ... is the first line of a poem of the lyrikers werner söllner , in which this in troubling language scrap the arrival of the experience of dissidents , the freedom has won , but also lost its language area .
born of the 1951 in the romanian banat werner söllner had first as a german and english - teachers in bucharest and later than editor worked in a kinderbuch publishing , before he 1982 to frankfurt am main relocated .
söllner has been awarded with various literature prices , 1993 it was the legendary frankfurter poetik lectures at the goethe university , and since 2002 , it is , director of the hessischen literature forum in mousonturm in frankfurt .
considerable except literary of publicity , he last tuesday during a meeting in munich , when it comes to ' german literature in romania in the mirror and distorting mirror their securitate acts ' .
confused and embarrassed söllner read out a clear statement , in which he before romania german writer colleagues , including richard wagner , william totok , franz hodjak , and helmuth women dorfer , its cooperation than in the for the romanian secret service securitate admitted .
together with some of the present had söllner 1989 the german language price received .
recruitment of trials have gradually begun , first 1971 .
so i am , söllner closed , ' someone who has campaigned against the securitate intimidation attempts not enough . "
werner söllner is in the lyricist walter .
almost at the same time , by honouring the nobel peace prize for herta müller and whose unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms dictatorial rule is the literature scene and in particular the community of german originating from romania authors shaken by a case , the plumb the depths and identify the despicable of a political system , which is based on monitoring , and domestic spying .
werner söllner is , so far we after bisherigem knowledge can say , not only , but also the perpetrators victims .
acts of in its securitate have played a role in the walter , said after the confession söllners the literature scientists michael markel and referred to the positive influence of the walter for him .
he had it in all at the time for him , " markel swindled out sensitive points ' .
it is a moral need him , this comment to make .
söllners declaration was in the form and above this audience unexpectedly , completely surprising is the commitment of a former dissident and its cooperation with the romanian secret services , however , not .
germany is a cosy reserve for securitate - have been informer , herta müller have already had in july , written in the time after it had read its own act , ; 914 sides , .
those who are affected , so we must be suspect , speculation and probably also in some case have known , what is behind the clear name aliases sorin , voicu and also walter lay .
unlike in the here now very procedure safe screening in the stasi - acts is dealing with the legacy of the securitate - monitoring still very diffuse .
thwarted a systematic information is in the past few years and has been hampered .
a the birthler - authority appropriate national council for getting to grips with the securitate - acts ( cnsas ) was established until 1999 , the launch of acts since then , however , has been rather slow .
only since 2005 , there is a law governing the management of acts .
that former influence securitate - members in romania is still very large , documented after the announcement of the nobel peace prize for herta müller an interview , in which a former head of securitate - from temesvar dismissive about the prize winner .
they have a psychosis , finally , they have only once interrogated .
the scandal of power said is quite openly in the shape of the freedom of expression here to express can .
certainly söllner include the case , as so often in connection with reticent blamed , unavoidable issues .
why only now ? who was harmed ? the measured response to listening to the söllners commitment gives hope that the continuation of this chapter of knowledge drive rather than guilt and shame will be determined .
to genese the plant from herta müller , who yesterday has received the nobel peace prize , it is more than a footnote .

dream worlds
some people see in wachem state images and hear vote , does not see or hear the other .
not only to the mentally ill and in the drugs binge blurring the borders between fantasy and reality .
as long as it happens in their sleep , everything is ok .
if we in our dark with our eyes closed rooms are , we must give us the unchecked wildest entities out ideas and imagination .
however , those who , in the wachsein dream - like conditions experienced , sees things and listens , does not see or hear the other , applies in the modern western world mostly as crazy or drug addiction , at least as a crank .
but images and vote of this kind arise not only on mental health or in narcotic drugs .
blame our imagination : the same neural processes that enable us to draw up homes to write to paint or images novels , sometimes have to ensure that the borders between the dream , delusion and reality are becoming increasingly blurred .
dream exponentially modified awake awareness conditions in many different forms can occur in the best - case scenario , we call them visions , in the worst case madness .
even if the trigger and effect may differ , the visions of mystikerin hildegard of bingen , the drugs experiences of the new - age - prophet carlos castaneda , schamanische entrückung conditions , psychoses and hallucinations but attributable to similar processes .
hallucinations or delusions arise if the balance of neural chemical lobes - above all dopamin , serotonin and noradrenaline , acetylcholin - off the rails and the interaction of various brain parts is disturbed .
complex hallucinations and wahnhafte idea are very often during a schizophrenic psychosis .
more about him has no power , the difficult
the context of delusion and dream has philosophers and medical professionals since antiquity .
aristotle concept hallucinations as a form of dream in the state , wilhelm griesinger , one of the founder of modern psychiatry , noted 1861 a " great similarity of the mistaken one with dream conditions ' , the dream of sigmund freud was even ' a psychosis , with all the inconsistencies , wahnbildungen , deceit of such a " sense .
it is autumn 2001 , when henning t. transformed into a comic strip figure .
his body is two dimensions and quietschbunt .
more about him has no power , the difficult , it hangs in the room ceiling .
enters it senses a .
behind him produce vicious make with blood red , distorted fratzen , teeth fletschend .
they hunting him , it with serious , inflammatory boots , throw him against the walls that he feels the pain in the whole body .
noisy , malicious vote roar from walls and radio .
it may no longer tolerate them , the votes , the abuse at him and insulting .
henning t. is tearing two cable out of the stereo , knotet it to a noose and brace of a crux of the ceiling .
it is rising on a loud speaker and the noose around the neck recede .
jumps .
resolves the noose .
scream that you should be a lesson , the vote in trommelfell zerfetzendem choir , ' go in the hospital , and let you cure ! '
today is henning t. 40 years old , it has six acute psychoses experienced , is the last two years back , the first almost 20 years .
it has been triggered by lsd .
his diagnosis is schizo affective - paranoid psychosis , it is also , it takes depressed bi - medicines , against the depression , the mania , the schizophrenia .
he has learned to live with his illness , since it is three years married .
in the psychosis , i have seen worst fear and deepest despair he says .
bore the images are ongoing , cruel reality
approximately one per cent of the population ill with schizophrenia ; at least once in their lives in psychiatric clinics they will be treated as second most common illness after the depression .
in an acute schizophrenic psychosis can affected more often than not distinguish more between domestic and foreign world , they get trapped in a state of on heated to hallucinations , sizes - relationships or persecution mania can lead to .
hear is the vote - particularly widespread vote , the orders , comment on or dialogisieren .
also optical hallucinations are not infrequently .
can the affected important can no longer be separated from trivial , the brain disturbing signals not more cost of purging , the system awareness is being inundated with impressions .
as the dream opens the psychosis the floodgates for a spate of ideas and fantasies , the deeper awareness classes bracket .
reality perception in the psychosis is entity centers , says professor thomas fox , oberarzt the clinic for general psychiatry in university klinikum heidelberg .
the schizophrenic finds itself in the centre of the loop , everything has an importance to him .
at the same time , it goes in a passive role , it will , in a similar dream , of the events overwhelmed and can you not actively shape .
schizophrenic therefore often feel threatened , controlled and manipulated .
matching is a reality you usually not possible , its fallacy images are ongoing , cruel reality , wake up excluded .
once in their lives to have seen a hallucinatory
unlike in the dream , but fox says , " remains the sensory and geographical structure of reality , which is perceived in the psychosis , received principle ' .
the obsession thoughts and hallucinations based in reality , the verfremdung of erlebens will take place at the real framework .
exactly why our brains vagaries proposes , researchers are still mystery .
exception in each people conditions can lead that he loses the relation to reality in the short term , fox says .
but not everyone will develop a psychosis .
there seem to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia , but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the determinants alone .
researchers assume that in affected minimal brain damage available .
we suspect that the brain maturing of the brain at an early stage of development will not be disrupted , by a viral infection of mother during pregnancy , for example , explained fox .
but there remain a puzzle , as the disruption of the neural system is reached , is also the first is not manifestiere for many years .
environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger for a psychosis be , if there is the line .
halluzinogene drugs can also trigger psychoses , because they interfere in the transmitter system .
if our brains is overheating
is the stupidity , psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medicines in order to get rid of them , others are spending money on drugs from , in order to obtain what , says the lübecker psychology professor erich caste .
whether contributed images are seen as a pleasant or unpleasant , is often only a question of the position .
caste collects for ten years ago , reports on hallucinations and fallacy phenomena , last year he has its results , in the book , ' the unreal world in our head ' evaluated .
hallucinations are among the typical side - effects of psychoses , but also from surprisingly many other illnesses .
these include mental disorders , such as borderline or depression often also , diseases such as migraines , too , epilepsy and multiple sclerosis or alzheimer 's and skull brain traumas .
surprisingly , hallucinations under certain conditions even the brain healthy people .
hallucinations , so caste , from memory content , which normally be held back .
they are , if areas , in which will be processed sensory , überaktiv are blocked or too little ; if our is lacking in brain is overheating , or also , if stimulation .
drugs can trigger this state as such as brain damage or psychosis .
barrenness , but also withdrawal , stress , love distress or other mental exception conditions .
recent studies have been up to a third of those polled said that at least once in their lives to have seen a hallucinatory .
in the summer of 2005 , sarah k. 16 years old , they live in a small town in mecklenburg - west pomerania and visited secondary school there .
a very normal girls , in fact .
if there were not the pictures and the vote .
in the break it can happen that a schlaksiger young with long , dark hair it addresses .
if it responds to the peers look at it surprised - nobody else does this see or hear young .
you believe that the timid girls for a versponnene day träumerin , but sarah k. not dreaming , it knows it .
awake , you can see and hear it is these young , just as they alongside them can see and hear the girls in the bank .
they can feel his presence even , at least for moments .
a pleasant this feeling is that they may the young .
am i crazy ? , , you sometimes wonder .
but you know that this young and the other contributed images is not are real and disappear again .
night , the phenomena are often frightening
contributed images are often also a burden .
if you in the area of the class , it can the teaching material is sometimes not consequences , because of teachers in their eyes and ears just presenting a new peers , while for all other hearing - and visible on the table mathematical equations explained .
night , the phenomena are often frightening .
if you in their dark waiting room on sleep , which is , of course , far too rarely and come too late , it can often differ not , whether it is awake or already dreams , whether the pictures you will see , the fratzen adversely affected or the girls with the average wounds of poor and legs , before their open or eyes closed .
let me is crying out in a calm , they to shape the .
parents and friends told nothing can prevent them , which would they consider to be crazy .
autumn 2009 . sarah k. is 20 years old today .
last year it has the insisted baccalaureate and live together with your friend .
before a year , the hallucinations have stopped .
since you on the internet contact with the psychologists caste has included , they know that it is not mad .
mania is also a work of art despair
if someone is socially isolated or under beauty withdrawal , however , has it in all probability , after a while hallucinations , says caste .
i suspect , then the brain is under - employed and , even for his entertainment .
sarah k. , an individual child , as a little girl had fear of other children , often , she played alone .
their hallucinations , when you began with 13 learned that the man that they can calls , since you thinking daddy , is not your leiblicher father .
because in visual and acoustic hallucinations same brain areas are also actively real impressions and noise process , it is affected as sarah k. difficulty distinguishing contributed images and reality . ' every experience , " castes , says ' will take place in the brain , the reality , there is .
hallucinations are also images which brain gives rise , therefore , they have so real . "
nighttime dream images also sees caste as a form of hallucinatory .
hallucinations of the healthy are not fundamentally different from those an acute psychosis .
unlike schizophrenic are mentally healthy in the situation , to recognise their contributed pictures as unreal .
caste advises his patients ' therefore , the hallucinations also as a special value ability .
border state between dream and hallucinatory
centred on too much awareness in our world will imaginary unfortunately witnessing mostly pathologizing , says mr schmidt - rapier hard , the clinic of psychiatry professor in heidelberg and chief doctor and psychotherapy of florence nightingale - hospital in düsseldorf .
a psychosis is a serious illness painful , but it also involves positive , creative - mania is also a work of art out of desperation .
dorte schmidt - rapier hard , the so-called oneiroide experience researched , has a special form of dream exponentially modified awake awareness .
oneiroide are highly complex , detailed quasi - dreams , the erlebende for real and which he is also in retrospect cannot distinguish from the state of the awake .
state of oneiroide awareness is emerging in trauma or illness extreme situations , for example in polyradikulitis patients , the experience in full awareness of a motor paralysis .
if a person in itself , and world is threatened loss , for example by continuing complete impotence , it replaces the life threatening by its own imagined world , the real situation is decoupled away from reality , schmidt says - rapier hard .
a kind of border state between dream and hallucinatory .
since the deal with a situation in reality is not possible , a world exchange is taking place , but the real situation will be made in the imagination bearing in mind .
an intensive form the foundation and a sense of meaning in a intolerable situation , the us human beings shape , not enables own submerged in nothing of loss of awareness .
everything is real , also later in the memory
also the züricher art historian peter cornelius claussen describes his oneiroid - experiences in his book the soul " heart change as a " bailout .
it is 49 years old , as its awareness for a heart valves operation followed by a heart transplant posted on travel , while his body on the intensive care is condemned to immobile .
claussen a appeared in a world made itself , visited foreign times and places : it was seen as bettlägerigen , old man , boarded a zugsanatoriums , a robot guards his health .
he lives in the early middle ages under royal , the drugs manufactured from blood .
will of a greeks kidnapped in a motorcycle whose own country , browses with his hospital bed in firn snow of the alps and is a korean mafioso .
he is entirely to be done in the imagined that everything is real , later in the memory .
these internal travel for claussen , is radically different from any dream .
dream is another state , be he describes .
quite the contrary , i am the memories of travel mental nor after years and in secondary details about clear .
clearer and more intensive even than really what happened .
goes beyond the intensity of this erlebens the horizon of our other life secular experience , says the psychiatrists schmidt - rapier hard .
ultimately show oneiroide , psychoses , hallucinations and drugs binge , how fragile our internally copies of external reality also ensure , are .
any change of awareness status , sums the psychologist castes , " can lead to an verformung of , what we call reality . '
an experience which , may even be enriching .

mazda would like to prove that athleticism is perfectly compatible with the protection of the environment .
for this reason has mazda recently in the model mazda3 the automatic stop christened and anfahr system of motors , on the behalf i - stop , introduced , a device , but the moment only for the 2.0 petrol engines with 150 ps available .
this second generation of the mazdas 3 stands by your good marks the overall picture .
the final processing , the implementation of the vehicle , the comfort , be straβenv received , the mechanics , the i - stop system ...

conclusion
ban on the mazda3 2.0 i - is one of the best compact car its class .
it is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used , because of its driving patterns and the diversity of resources .
auβerdem those who are not many kilometres a year , also the i - stop version buy , the only with a 2.0 petrol engines with 150 ps is available .
be the only negative aspect of this model is but a high price , of between eur 21.770 for the model luxury and 23.270 euro for the test wariness model sportive lies .
than return to this high price , however , the mazda3 offers us , every day new highest driving passport .
a first with a great deal of ' glamour '
l. example is the red tepppich the sensuality for penélope cruz , nicole kidman and fergie from .
attending the premiere of ' nine ' resonated with the stars , clothed in models , which will be as elegantly as sexy , more than ever . ( photographs : gtre online ) .
elegantly our ' pe ' , as always , opted for a dark " lady ' - dress .
the promises of fonpeek
peek is äuβerst limited , a device which can only be read his e- mails , without a possibility , able to see certain annexes or able to surf around the internet .
enjoyed it has its five minutes fame , when it the magazine time to chose one of the products of the year .
it on the straβe to see , is unlikely , but the idea in itself is nevertheless especially for young people of interest .
contrary to the smart phones costs very little peek and has a very favourable unmetered access , for example , just the half the price of a flat rate of iphone .
after the success of the companies in mind , it has two new equipment placed on the market : one , which is intended only for twitter , the other with a life free service for data , unlike the peek , in which you pay a price six times higher .
fonpeek , which was presented yesterday in the event le web , the european version of this invention and is thus your third version .
it has the same limits , as his american counterpart , however , there is a surprise one .
maintenance of the monthly price for the telephone , around eur 12 in the month , includes roaming for the whole of europe .
those who travel with a smartphone around the world , already know what it means , to forego all the data must , in order to be able to read his e- mails , as soon as we the country has cross , or when we desperately looking after a café with wifi ( or of a link possibility with fon ) .
the idea of the roaming with flat - rate is incredibly tempting and really should be possible for a long time .
it is true that some telephone providers already specific offer contracts and prices for stays abroad , but in my experience , it needs already a doctorate in physics and a good spectacles , in order to be able to read all of this small print .
the repeated criticism on the part of the european commission in terms of affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of europe remained almost always ignored .
auβerhalb of their own country has always be afraid to read his e- mails and rightly so .
that a small machine as fonpeek ( with it but always astonishing is that it has the name fon , although it has no wifi / wlan ) can offer this kind of tariffs , that means the telephone providers , slowly but surely rethink and must start to find different ways to take into account , as you can use their data network .
kindle is another good example of this , in its prices is the downloaded of books and other questions contained in the internet .
without vetrag and without snags .
it is capable of an internet equipment and one is paying only a single time , namely the purchase , and not month by month .
and this is exactly what i also expect fonpeek one day , a purchasing possibility of life for a long time internet access as it is the peek already offered in the united states .
and that is not because i would like to buy it .
i would like to thank my e- mails , with the phone read .
but i expect this , because i believe that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer .
it would be interesting , however , is with the same time a computer system able to see .
the fetish colour of michelle
yellow is , without a doubt , the favourite colour of the american first lady .
already at the inauguration of barack obama as president of the united states they have appeared in a dress and a mantle of the colour and has the same colour re- elected , in order to him in his , without doubt , the second most important moment in his life to accompany : the award of the nobel peace prize in oslo .
michelle obama has very similar models on two occasions : auβer that it was nearly the same colour - a shining green yellow - , there was a clothing from three parts - dress , jacket and coat - the same substance , and it has contributed something groβförmig gesticktes or a halskette .
it even goes so far as , for the first sight it seems that the first lady of the united states had wanted to follow the example of the princess of asturias and had decided , the same dress in more than just an occasion to bear .
however , the two clothes are very different in the stoffart manufactured , from which they are .
at the inauguration it has a dress from top and in oslo one from gemusterten office .
accessories were also different : the first time green footwear with half high paragraphs and the second time a änhliches model , but gold colours .
also the hair was different : each time the hair were on this occasion as haarkranz high , with the previous it has the hair openly .
75 % of the working mothers , because of their maternity problems are given in the work
discrimination in the work has increased over recent years , especially in the younger women , which want to have children .
to achieve this result is the of csic study carried out in cooperation with the european institute for women ' fertility and career of women in spain ' .
the survey 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt in that respect : 75 % of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market due to their maternity restricted .
open the study , that it very broad differences in the decision to start a family , and the number of children are , according to whether or not the women work and if so , what kind of professional exercise them .
those of you who auβerhalb of the house not carry out other activities , only part-time work or have no permanent employment contract , are more likely to become mothers and have more children .
in contrast , the women postpone , with a fixed employment , particularly in the public sector , the creation of a family and motherhood , and that is why we have also fewer children .
' the women in the age group between 35 and 49 years , with a fixed employment get their first child on average only 3.7 years after the pooling , a figure which is to 4.1 years for women with an increased employment , the taken longer to have to achieve this and draw together the her and the first child until much later have achieved .
auβerdem has also the type of work a groβen influence on motherhood , albeit less than the calendar with regard to the moment of conception willingness , " says the csic - researcher margarita delgado .
the level of education is another factor , the age of women must be taken into account when the marriage and the first child .
according to the survey is the age the time of the marriage and the first child , the higher the higher the level of education and training .
this difference could also be found in the same age of women .
for example , the women in the group between 35 and 49 years , according to whether they only have the main school or a higher education , on average each with 25,1 or 32,1 for the first time mother .
also , there is , according to their level of education , a further difference between the women .
while the women with main final conclusion before their first permanent employment marry and have their first child , make it the women with a medium- sized or large school exactly the other way around and seek out only a permanent employment and marry later and will receive their first child , delgado notes .

cowardly aggression
my 70 -year-old mother came last week by our part in the municipality of walking fuenlabrada than suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years alongside their and our dog herliefen , our dog is a mischling that we have obtained from the animal sanctuary and the just six kilos is more , and then thunderstruck to missed they him two fußtritte and injured it so difficult .
our indignation it is not in words , since it is us incomprehensible where since the spass in a cheap agression against a small and defenceless animals should be , which has of course been carried out at the leash .
added to that is the suffocation megalomaniacs , the weather was walking a woman who received , than they these people because of the incident reprimanding wanted to , they even feared for their own lives , because if such a raving attacked a dog , it is also the same perhaps with a woman , a child , an older mr or probably even with every make that the weaker than he himself is .
normally the incident occurred in a calm city quarter at five p.m. on an ordinary tuesday .
has the dog the whole day geheult .
of course , we have in a close situated police service , but that we have reported grave doubts about whether that will bring anything at all and in order to prevent any prejudice from the outset , we only want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals spaniards were .
our indignation about what has happened has led us , this incident .
we will not be able to understand what must be in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a defenceless animal fun , of an animal that gives us the love , society and friendship .
do we know where the good education and the respect for the animals and the people have remained .

the sale of small lorries rising again something to
begins , after almost two years the car market for small transporters finally see some light at the end of the dark tunnel .
the 9.425 vehicles , the in november in spain were allowed , mean a 12.6 % increase in relation to the year 2008 , and , what is far more important still is , they are so that the first increase at all after 22 consecutive months with constant decline , gemäβ the association of anfac and the car dealers by manufacturers association ganvam presented figures .
however , this good figures are time only with groβer caution to genieβen , as the reference data used for comparison of november 2008 , which are a particularly bad verkau year with a reduction of around 60 % in respect of the previous year was .
however , we must bear in mind that , apart from the increase in the last month , the overall authorisations this still 11 months of 40 % below the sales figures of the previous rules year .
since january , as a whole were 95.853 vehicles sold , in this number , but all vehicles , from which the vans market is , include : descendants of passenger cars to pick - ups , easier small vans , small vans and lorries / chassis .
furthermore , are still in the sky , the same storm clouds which demand , because most affect even if some of the vehicles be bought by individuals , the groβteil of sales to small and medium- sized enterprises , which in nearly 100 % of all cases , the purchase by a third funding working .
so we must these restrictions , what the result of the authorised turned flow of credit institutions , are further factors with einschlieβen , such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the continuation of the poor economic situation .
in this scenario , and , in contrast to the passenger cars have the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the plan 2000e little helped .
however , this plan is not only determines for private persons , including self- employed and small companies to have a right , if they are a small vehicle up to 3.5 tonnes with a co2 ausstoss , which must not exceed 160 grams per mileage , want to buy , but the low sales figures speak for themselves .
just yesterday had ganvam again remind you that it is part of the state necessary , is also a special emphasis on these small lorries , as well as , of course , for the industry vehicles ( lorries and buses ) .
prophesied the car dealers association for the year 2010 a similar year such as the just last , for which there with a sales ( of default in passenger cars and offroad vehicles ) by 19 % .
the support in brake exercises in critical situations is now duty
as was already in the anti- lock braking bremssystem ( and as it now happening with the esp stability control , the aid systems must become the brakes in emergencies a duty equipment in the european cars will be .
indeed , they are duty in all newly registered passenger cars and light small trucks , for the remaining vehicles a karenzfrist until the end of february 2011 was set .
adopted by the european union the maβnahme has the objective , to improve the protection of fuβgänger , however , these braking systems because of their working , so that it will also help to prevent many front - rear collisions .
the task of emergency braking systems is , more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical brake on the basis of the system maneuver , carried out by the drivers brake strength on the brake recognises to exercise .
however , is not until the end this pressure from this system .
according to a commissioned by the component manufacturers for the bosch vehicles study , a third of the drivers involved in an accident was not before the toss together even more to do it , on the brake to enter into force and half of them had not with full force slowed down .
up to 1.100 accidents
the brake assistance against attacks with maximum force in the braking system a and reduced by the brake time and thus also the braking distance , a car when brake process back .
according to a study by the eu could up to 1.100 fatal accidents every year , where fuβgänger harm to come , be avoided , if all cars are equipped with this type of emergency braking systems .
it would be even less accidents - it is estimated that every fourth accident with regard to personal damage be prevented could - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems be popular .
then the vehicle is equipped with a system that ( on radar or a camera ) obstacles recognizes the driver and cautions , with it at the same time a slight pressure on the brakes .
if the driver subsequently responded , helps him the system , to increase the pressure on the brake , it would be necessary .
if the drivers not respond to the warning and even if the toss already is unavoidable , together , the brake assistants the maximum pressure on the brakes from , in this way , to keep the damage as low as possible .
general motors postpones the plan for opel until january
while the workforce of opel plant at figueruelas ( zaragoza ) already by nick reilly , the new chairman of general motors ( gm ) europe , have been informed that the production of meriva new at will start in the first week of april , probably on 8 , according to javier ortega , the american car manufacturers of pointing out that he needs more time in order to bring the rescue plan for opel to a conclusion .
nick reilly , the new chairman , by gm europe wants to achieve , namely the fact that the affected side their assent on each individual point of the plan is already in advance .
and for this very reason , it may be that the final document , the first workers and then the governments of the countries in which it works are , to be presented until will postpone in early 2010 .
dementgegen will from gm assured that , in the next few days , it will take a decision regarding the sale of saab .
because it is not surprising that the swedish government the pressure on the american car has increased , so that this a decision as soon as possible .
gm are , to be in contact with a number of possible new buyers .
one of these buyers could be geely , which would also like to buy up volvo , however , the option of dutch manufacturer of skyper - sports , by the group of the russian converg backing has , attracting an ever - stronger .
if it none of these buyers should come to an agreement , could gm some assets to the chinese baic sell .

at the helm of the porsche boxster spyder
for the development of their latest and very expensive jewel used by the engineers the boxster s but really , as a basis and managed to make things easier for him to 80 kilos , and he now brings only 1.275 kilos of balance .
abandoning in order to create something you firstly on the automatic aufklappbare ceiling , which has been replaced by a tent manuellem powered screen umbrella , so that we alone has saved ; thanks to the 21 kilograms in this model used aluminium doors such as the gt3 ' disappearance ' further 15 ; by the exclusion of the air conditioning once again 13 ; auβerdem the tank of 64 to 54 litres of fuel has been reduced , so that have been further 7 kilos ; saved by the fitting of sporting bacquet - are still time , 12 and with the slight 19 - customs - wheels again saved five .
then it was also still by the relinquishment of the audio - system - 30 cdr was once again six kilos less and through the exchange of türgriffe handles from substance which lack kilo achieved .
although it also with the gear box double clutch wheels pdk available is , the test was carried out with a vehicle with 6 - conventional hand wheels , mainly on the smaller landstraβen of california , to mountain routes , the really very kurvig were .
during his driving behaviour we can only give the mark irreproachable him .
reducing its weight has led but by no means that he now no longer so sure would be on the straβe .
it is rather the opposite is the case : since long we have already no longer such a small and light model test dangers , the a but also a feeling of groβer security in the curves , even at high speed , are .
able to do this , it is a small athlete , flex its muscles in a low motion in the time required to make warm , until we to give him the orders lawn to curb to recover and then again to get everything from his engine ...
he makes everything what he says . the car power everything , what we him with our hands at the wheel indicate that , thanks to its steering , which is as communicative as also precise .
and it is doing so with the accuracy of surgeons .
engine of a sound for all tastes
the sound his v6 boxers with 320 ps ( 10 more than the boxster s ) is very good and it is possible to increase him with the ' sport ' - option and by means of a system that the engine noise can change , which already the panamera used for the first time .
brutally the speeding up assets is inconceivable , whether from the stand or when re- speed up .
the federungen strong , however , are not severe or inconvenient .
on the asphalt alter the landstraβen , on which we with the boxster spyder went , was already quite damaged , but the car meisterte the bumps well .
the electronic assistants had on the whole route virtually nothing to do ; and , despite the fact that we in some of these curves ice in the morning and rollsplitt took this morning .
summing up , we can say that it is an ultra - easy car , a car , with whom you have an indescribable driving passport has , as it otherwise rather rarely are and there is much more than just a small improvement in him of the boxster ss .
the car will come in february 2010 on the market and will cost eur 70.831 .

pays the baskonia to victory in itself israel
the caja laboral celebrated , despite the many fancy players in the team mr against mr ivanovic , an excellent triumph with 82 - 91 during his visit on the complicated fuβballfeld of maccabi electra and so , on the first place within his group after the groβartigen appearance of mirza teletovic , with eight triple the best of his team was ( 29 in the assessment ) .
could the team from vitoria the significant loss of herrmann , oleson , huertas or micov by means of a very broad dose to use and replace team work , even if you wait until the bitter end to its victory muβten .
the great hit with 16 from the perimeter valued triple maβgeblich contributed to their final victory in .
the game began with the leadership of the blue red , right from the start at the top table , on the advertisements .
since the first four baskets the team from vitoria already from the perimeter came , we have already seen guess that you on the playing field with well reheated hand gelenken were .
there were english and teletovic , mainly for the 18 - 20 at the end of the first quarter were responsible .
the second quarter was little different , only that the team from álava that opted for a way game of barac of the interior and for the game of judge eliyahu , which , with its return to the team was received with pfiffen and applause , be the home is , in order to break expanding their advantage further ( 34 - 43 ) .
teletovic already began as the best of his team with 13 points highlight , also wennn ' minus six ' assessment of the cluster can already guess lieβen that this would not be the best evening of brazilian .
nevertheless , despite the clear advantage in the break the game was not yet been decided and the makkabäer wanted the vitorianer once again remind you that on their playing field not win , and thanks to the repeated attacks ' hand of elías ' they came back into the game .
eidson and pnini helped crucial that the " yellow ' the helm umdrehten ( 50 - 49 ) .
still more disadvantages
mr the team of ivanovic , violated , but anything other than dead , had to a few gambits with soundness prepare , in order to get air again and in one of them was suddenly the gun of mirza teletovic , with three almost successive triple and with the support of english and ribas ensured that advertisements on the table again a more reassuring gap by ( 54 - 67 ) been notified , the host at the end of the third quarter with ( 57 - 67 ) beautify could .
were the alavesen in the last quarter bloβ and english and san emeterio ( 60 - 75 ) , already announced that they would allow anyone , you the victory that they are in the first dreiβig minutes honest deserved , taking back .
nevertheless , resigned pnini and eidson , not the best of their team and tried , your team by three points of the line ( 70 - 77 ) force to be .
nevertheless , and although cluster because fouls being made by the place , mr the team of ivanovic was not on , defended good and even though the israelis are still in the last minute aufholten ( 80 - 85 ) , the game have already had a victors and tel aviv lost for the first time in this season .
violations prevented that standardisation caja stood up to was
standardise caja lost loudly in greece against olympia cos and the leadership in the group had to cede b of the euroliga to him , and that in a game , by the intemperate remarks on the part of the players of unicajas ( free country , lima and archibald ) , in particular , the interior game , was marked , what the greeks facilitated victory .
the team from malaga had neither fear the mood in the hall of peace and friendship before the opposing team , which is perhaps one of the most of europe and has a lot of money .
thanks to your offer game in first quarter andalusians were allowed to start to dream . a aggresive defence and three successive three times , two by omar cook and one by guillem rubio , the host with 12 - 18 in the 9 minute .
olympia cos was by the intensity of the ereins uni caja surprised , even if the indigenous team with an internal game between bourousis , vujcic and schortsanitis managed that the displays table in the 13 minute 22 anzeigte - 20 in their favor , the minute , in the it as a result of an action almost to affray between the two americans beverley and would have been to williams and which is why both disqualified have been .
the greek team started , warm weather at last to be and its superiority in two halves of the game , while the departure of the englishman joel free country as a result of a violation of and the three itself caused error by carlos jiménez significant traces in the standardisation caja behind lieβen .
under their players in the field of interior and the lithuanian before players linas kleizas , with its triple , they increased its advantage in the 19th minute to 44 - 32 .
impossible was a race

many thanks !
after the most tempting days since last spring , in which the inflation of assets the prevailing sentiment was on the markets , on the markets is returned the insecurity , which is in any case surprising , because this is their natural state , in an environment in which the broker decisions on an inherently uncertain future meeting .
it was the maβnahme used to stabilise the markets , the debt to pay with the direct purchasing of assets and indirectly the liquidity free hand in interest rates , the move to the zero , so that in this way the banks assets to buy totting up .
the central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are as good as closed , and without their heterodox policy to the liquidity to call into question , start to spread , some sand in the wheels , as the bce näc already having eighth with its annual auction , which will take place next week .
therefore the investors doubt the capacity of the world economy , the economic recovery without this heterodox maβnahmen maintain and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums .
the flüchtigkeiten the stock markets and the differences in the companies bonuses rise again , even if they are still far removed from the paramilitary normal amounts , the they achieved at the beginning of the year .
the member states have been forced to nationalize private risks and the state debt to rise again .
we will now again on quality and the united states , japan and germany , are the privileged shelter of the investors , resulting in an increase of the differences in respect of germany leads the countries of the euro area .
spain has until now hardly affected by this episode of instability , but then came standard & poor 's and threatened with a new revision downwards in the assessment of spain .
damages on the other hand a degree of uncertainty is not , in order to silence the defenders of the moral risk , once again had tried , in the responsible an awareness of the world economic policy , for what they had caused , to produce , since they the devastating effects , to which the restriction of credit led to the loss of jobs have slowed down , as they had a new day for the thanks to action beschlieβen should .
nevertheless , what has happened in dubai , there is a tribal war between the emiren , in order to restore the power in the emirates and the development in greece was also foreseen earlier .
conceals a government , which the public debt , elections , and a new government , which at the same thing .
prodi made it in italy after berlusconi and sócrates in portugal after durão barroso .
it makes no sense that ecofin hungary at the beginning of the year save from the non- fulfilment of its foreign payments and thus a euro - member country is allowed , not to honour its commitments .
however , it is logical that ecofin has forced the greek government , to be transparent and its citizens to the need for auβergewöhnlicchen maβnahmen with in the duty to take , in order to maintain the stability of the state money .
yes , as expected , we are facing a episode of normalisation of risk premiums , after some excesses to large sums of money , and this would now within the expected .
in the case of spain , we must not worry , as long as the differences the state of debt with the same speed as the european companies bonuses increase .
reduce should , however , the european differences and the spanish , to continue to increase dannn would it is a special spanish risk action .
the standard & poor 's is a farce . while the local early indicators a groβteil obliges the market research institutes , their scenarios for the recovery preferable and their scenario for 2011 to be revised upwards , einschlieβlich the ocde and the european commission , which once with a japanese scenario promises for the spanish economy , all this despite warnings not long life span .
once again , it seems quite that it is an excellent opportunity to buy spanish share , although at the moment ' caution when drive ' is needed .
related industries
the chairman of iberdrola , ignacio sánchez galán , as the first met yesterday before the european parliament 's subcommittee on , where in these days the strategy in relation to the energy supply spain will be debated in the next two decades .
after his appearance to the chairman of gas natural - fenosa , rafael villaseca followed , was galán some of the key points of the press about what he had made the subcommittee on behind versschlossenen doors .
according to the chairman of iberdrola euround 50 billion by 2020 , spain must invest further from this date 60 billion between now and 2030 , under the pretext that the current nuclear power stations also continue to remain in operation .
this should not be the case , would not on the investment needed 60 billion , but until 95 billion .
iberdrola of the opinion that there is , however , no longer into an increase in the energy production capacity should invest , but in distribution networks and international groupings .
from 2020 onwards , the question will change and we should increase the performance .
his proposal focuses on both gas and coal works of co2 capture with establishments and particularly , of course , on renewable energies .
in this case he assumes that 18,000 mw more are needed , under the pretext of course , by other ' support energy ' .
galán is , of the opinion that the gesetentwurf for a sustainable economic , which has just adopted by the government , is in line with what his company has called for , in any case wanted to say something against this law , such as incentives for the national coal consumption to create what , exactly the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change would be .
his opinion ' , long term , we clearly in this direction , despite some ' individual ' maβnahmen , as you described the chairman of iberdrola .
be that as it is galán believes that we , as of now , the decisions on the investment , even if these are long term , should make , since it will need some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created , in order to tackle them .

barça again earned with his victory in the european supercup in august 2.5 million .
however , this still the payments , for the variables 337,8 million are earmarked .
this money is proportional to the value of every individual television market awarded .
has the spanish is in the first and 4 allocated to jobs .
