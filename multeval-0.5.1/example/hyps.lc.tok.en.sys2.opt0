the sortier - be smell in brno müllcontainer not well
in prague , people can the drinks packaging sorting , in the südmährischen villages will again be in step and enters the sortier - müllcontainer .
and in brno ?
there should be set aside a few minutes ago , in order to find the appropriate garbage can .
i will not say that the waste in brno would be not to operate at all .
but it is me , al whether the ratsherren is insufficient take care of this problem , even if we are the second biggest city in the republic .
brno in the abfalltrennen finds itself in the urwaldliga , not only because we as citizens here in the sortiercontainer always only dispose of paper , glass and plastic must , but , above all , through the mülltonnenanzahl for such waste .
you have some time in the centre , for example , tried to dispose of the pet bottles in a sammelkorb ?
this is just art , above all , it needs time and nerve .
the only position that i have accidentally found in up to now , is taken of the mährenplatz towards the goose .
mr onderka us its members are supposed to me , not get angry , but this is far too little .
apart from the fact that the waste also in other parts is not a honigschlecken .
whole ranks of my friends sorting that is why the waste would prefer not to do anything .
from laziness .
it is that you too far to the garbage can .
i am not surprised .
i have even after the celebration of offered to dispose of , a few glass and plastic bottles .
but on the konicova streets in sight , i have not seen any farbmülltonnen .
fortunately the straßenbahnfahren i came to the right place .
but almost on the waste expired .
this is but is still represents the centre of brno , thus making the whole city , is not true ? !
however , ecology and any kind of aesthetic the brünner socialists probably cold .
they are buying a eishockeyliga prefer the city , the us in the whole of the republic disgrace power , rather than a few garbage cans to buy more and to offer the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner brno .
i am glad that i was able to confirm my assumption also with official statistics , after i have looked for a while on the internet .
according to the data of the society be really eko - com is brno in whole district südmähren the worst since .
the " democrat paroubek placed ' - budget has the money for pensions and sick from
after the left party in spite of the opinion of the government the farmers and officials , more money , in the budget is no more money for pensions , sickness and bauspargeschäft available .
but also for the staatsschuldzinsen or for the international gerichtsstreite .
the causes which have more problems , the in the government in the second half of next year will be , the finance ministers , edvard janota says .
the salary increase for some groups as the socialists and communists have enforced , they expect to see the government is the money for the sensitive expenditure , pensions or for the sickness in addition , borrows . ' that is only a postponement of the problems in the future , minenlegen , " says janota .
from the loans will be nähmlich always pay higher interest rates , and we must eventually have to return the money .
too much to the choice , where the treasury is empty .
if the social benefits or costs for the state ownership , to increase the tax are not be reduced .
for all the , which gave money to the left party now more : the fire service , the teachers , the farmers .
and , later , also for their children .
in order to the pensions or the sickness benefit , of whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared , people must have no fear , you will have this money .
but at the price that the state debt - in the next year will be even more so in the public coffers lack not only 163 billion , but far more .
despite the efforts of the minister janota will increase the debt ever more quickly and this , too , together with the cost and interest rates .
the state is the need for the money to compensate , then already will no longer suffice to increase the vat slightly or to cut the maternity benefits , as the government in her gegendefizit package .
because of the geldabwälzung in next year , be in favour of certain wahlvolksgruppen five billion for the development of the lack of motorways and railways .
it is mainly the sections gained from the competition , which we can no longer new projektieren and perhaps cheaper .
most received , which is also not free of charge .
this means delay or cancellation of thirty great buildings , is also the europe - money , the spokesman of the warns of transportation , karel hanzelka .
the cssd has proposed that it solves the flow of money afraid - it takes up the cez - aktiendividenden , in which the state owners of the majority and then , from this is the money will be thrown out in the transport fund .
the problem is that the level of dividend is never certain and it is not a source of endless .
in last year , flowed from cez 18 billion in the budget .
every year the environmental damage - liquidationenbezahlt from the dividends , the pensionskonto expanded , and this money is also acting as a reserve for the planned pension reform .
with this trick rising in addition , under the rules of the eu the actual budget deficit to the nieveau of 5.7 % gdp .
this brings to an end the carnival of the changes but not yet .
almost three billion , the budget for various compensation for victims of communism , and of criminal offences or for expenditure for the gerichtsstreite , even for the bausparen .
whether the state of manage without this money is not sure .
this is a pure lottery .
if we lose an international gerichtsstreit , then we need to pay anyway , this makes janota clear .
the minister then needs to save the money ressortintern or in the worst case the regierungsbudgetreserve attack .
a hundred million lack also for the already begun zweimilliardenprojekt ' treasury ' , is to allow the on- line to monitor , for what the einzelbehörden spend the money .
the first stage starts in january .
the finance ministers should find the money not elsewhere , the project should be stopped and in this case , sanctions janota warned .
their next smartphone will dominate two operating systems
the americans count for the future with a mobile phone , on which the users can switch by pressing a single button between different management systems .
the plans submitted see promising .
it is , only to push a button enough , and in the change from windows mobile will within a few seconds android .
the american society wants to precisely such a possibility vmware imagine , which , above all on the development of the virtual softwares concentrated in favour of computers .
we allow them , on the mobile phone two anwenderprofile , at the same time , to carry out .
you can switch between this , you will be able to deal with those in two separate home - and arbeitsprofile .
both are work in parallel , indicated srinivas krishnamurti vmware of the company in the interview for the magazine computerworld to .
it was presented in november last year and a few days ago for the first time before .
on the market will come in 2012 .
the smart - phones virtualization is not a fiction .

schneemangel plaguing hotel owners on the mountains
scneelose runways make sorgenn not only the riesengebirgen - residents .
the lack of snow discourages people also of the appointment of the skiaufenthalte in hotels and pensions .
we can therefore in giant still free room for all wintertermine incl . christmas and new year 's eve received .
our sides are often visited .
the people go through the offers , note the prices , but now they are afraid to appoint , binding .
and if you call us , you ask whether , in our opinion , this year 's christmas immediately to snow or ' , the operators will be on matsch " of the information spindl.info , martin jandura .
who the new year 's eve - wants to stay in the spindelmühle exactly according to his ideas , should not hesitate more with the appointment .
who preferred the save and in which the quality of the stay only in second place , of the can try to make a few days to wait .
the spindelmühle - hotelbesitzer provide now for the silvestertag mostly only wochenaufenthalte in .
i think that you are going to try to ensure that , for a time to sell this , but then also have they yield , and , at shorter times .
and then the free room will quickly dwindle , jandura estimated .
free beds in all winterterminen always provides always also the travel agency ingtours in vrchlabi .
the us most interested in now weihnachtswoche , which is not yet been sold out .
in our offer is approximately half of the places still freely .
therefore , have we already have some cheaper weihnachtsaufenthalte prepared for the last moment , the director of the travel agents ingtours , petr schiefert .
the silvestertag in giant the vrchlabi - travel agency can also offer here , but there is less free seats .
good paragraph will also find the first fortnight in february , the remaining wintertermine be sold on average .
in this year is the interest for the winteraufenthalte also negatively affected by the fact that in giant is always no snow .
the people are waiting , whether snow falls .
no one wants to spend the year in the mountains without snow .
should the runways within a week , will also be verschneit the christmas to be sold out , be schiefert says .
the other way round and a little better than in last year , it succeeds in the room in the hotel horizon in pecpod snezkou to occupy .
we are about five per cent better than in the previous year .
on silvestertag and christmas we only have a few free rooms .
there is a great deal of interest in the polish holidays in the janua , and in february , the business will also go well , informed the director of the best pec hotels , karel rada .
for 80 % of the silvesteraufenthalte is also the hotel omnia zentralparkplatz in janske lazne occupied .
on the other hand , to christmas will remain in the most recent hotel in janske lazne nor the half of the beds freely .
very pleasant surprise us in the january this year , for which we are already around 60 % occupied at the present time .
is a bit weaker the february in the meantime , but at the moment is , if the snow , certainly also increases the interest in the visits to the giant , the director of the hotel omnia , erik sporysch .
waiting for a greater schneebescherung the giant mountains - hotelbesitzer now .
on thursday it should be allowed to cool down and if it comes to rainfall , the snow on the mountains should be .
but it is intended to again a warming , informed jiri jakubsky come from the location of the czech wetteramtes in hradec kralove .
united states : repetition is mother of wisdom
it is almost strange , schülerstrebsamkeit barack obama , with which the president with his reputation of the brightest , the strategy of his predecessor in the afghanistan - issue repeatedly , the he felt even the most stupid .
when he finally its afghanistan - awaited doctrine ausschwitzte , it was that he on the kopierpapier from the bush - iraq szenariovor abschrieb three years .
not only that it in the text itself on several occasions used the expression ' as in the iraq ' , it has even the name of the bush - declaration of january 2007 as the name of its own declaration : ' new vorwärtsweg ' used , without hesitation .
he has even three years ago , the idea of bush - send fresh troop contributions in the troubled by the civil war iraq , as the ' irresponsible and criticized in their conclusions karastrophische decision ' .
on the following months showed , however , that the bush - of the recommendations of military personnel strategy was the only possible and to this extent very successful today to be in the news that more not talking about iraq at all .
bush 's reputation has not been improved , because he has his successor objectively hintergelassen a much dankbarere starting point , as it was to be expected .
in afghanistan barack obama hopes of the fact that the miracle repeating itself .
in order to increase in the contingent of troops have him again asked the military , above all , the oberkommandeur of the afghanistan - operation general stanley mccristal , even despite the subordinationsgewohnheiten criticised the vacillating protect hard in the white house .
he called for 40 000 soldiers , in order to be able to reverse the situation for the better .
the president hesitated three months , but it is on a better idea , and so he has the general wenistens they have been cheated of 10 000 soldiers .
from europe he has the commitment for another 5,000 pressed , at least with 10 000 , even if he originally expected .
to be of the whole obama strategy is highly problematic project , to withdraw the troops from afghanistan , as has already been in 18 months , and to complete this process within three years . the whole obama doctrine leaves than answers more questions .
some of us , doubt that the increase in the same effect as halved the measure will bring in iraq .
also , despite the war of fratricide of recent years , the iraq - society is relatively well - structured , their leaders honour the values .
the afghan situation is characterised by the kontraindikation - it can rely on anyone agreements and there will be no .
in these conditions , it is difficult , prepare for the afghan security forces which are accustomed , every day to change their mind .
the political institutions , even if they have been set up , only scheinbauten remain formally correct , behind which the patriarchal stammbeziehungen further towards can be .
the balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated , particularly due to confusion of the situation , which complicate the pakistan - and iran - influences even further .
also the building of a " competent state ' , which is the minimalist aim of the whole operation , is very unrealistic .
time horizon of the obama strategy by its voluntarism
over the last eight years , only in the situation in afghanistan has deteriorated further and now it is on the brink of explosion .
believe that the small soldiers , which broke out in the war on the ' frühheimkehr ' are here , a miracle , can only create a really romantic soul , which is not influenced by facts .
from the political view is the datumssetzung for the withdrawal mere irresponsibility , because the taliban , as will enter into the indirect confession the american defeat .
the last nato summit showed that the willingness of europeans to participate in the disputes in afghanistan , is running out .
also not explain to europe 's politicians can and want to their voters , the way in which the security of germany or italy with the war in the hindu kush - gebirgsvorland connected .
another possible factor , the radically can influence the situation , is the development of the events in iran .
should continue to worsen the situation and the increased sanctions in the iranians not work , for the united states a very serious question arises , whether the problem is not with troops to resolve .
this is a question that has to be answered in the period , in which america after obama to siegerabzug proceed from afghanistan .
any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the afghan situation .
the only sticking plaster for barack obama is the fact that there is still remain three years until the presidential election , and therefore is still enough time , so that it can resort to a other strategy , fallls this prove totalausfall would .

the high prämienboni in the banking sector , with the start of the financial crisis in a series of länders become the most controversial political issue .

traditionally , the american president , barak obama already today , the most expected friedennobelpreis afternoon received in oslo .

the history of sport , rassenverhältnissen told and on nelson mandela .
the tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid government in the south african republic , as well as its first black presidents , nelson mandela , is in his life , american oscar - actors , morgan freeman , .
freeman said that he was asked by the einundneunzigjährigen mandela , whether he might be in the eastwood movie it .
a further significant role matt damon .

the zweiundsiebzigjährige actor who played the prize for his role in the eastwood - drama receive from the boxbereich ' million dollars baby ' , had already been the leader of the movement on the abolition of slavery , from the end to - day slave has become , a fictitious us president , and also in ' evan omnipotent god , " but rarely , someone who is still alive , and is so important for many people , like mandela .
the former südafrikanischestaatsmann was for his active work in the end of apartheid in the south african republic for 27 years in prison .
he was released in 1990 to undfür four years he was president of the country .
the nobel peace prize in 1993 it was .
' invictus ' is the latin word for ' ungeschlagen ' , and at the same time it is of the name of a gedichtes of the english author william ernest henley , which has been 1875 issued in the years .
the requirement to speak , as he was
the film , a real moment in the nelson mandela its forces with the captain of the south african rugbyteams , francois pienaar , zusammenschloss , in order to agree on the statute of the country . the new president mandela also know that his people after apartheid still remains shared rassenmäßig , as well as economically .

finally , the south african team is rising by in the world of the year 1995 .
freeman worked on this point that several years , in order to bring the mandela - history on the cinema screens that .
he had no other aim than to play this role in this way , in order to move closer to the reality to this as closely as possible , said freeman .
the main challenge was , of course , so to speak , as it .
the actors has said , if he would be in the same country , and the world leader he would try to meet with mandela , with him to evening to eat , and in his speech to be behind the scenes .
for him , was the most important to shake hands with mandela .
i have noticed , when i say that the hand schüttele , i accept your energy , it will be transferred , and i had the feeling that , i know what they are feeling he said .
it is important for me , to have become another person .
matt damon is in the film françois pienaar , captain of the national rugbyteams , in which the white players have triumphed .
the actors said that he has had six months time , prepare for the role in the hard rugbywelt .
it was a big surprise for him , when he met pienaar for the first in his house .
i , as i remember the türklingel rang that he opened up to françois pienaar and the first thing i said in my life , i see : ' in the film was much greater from ' .

lichtgeheimnis on norway dissolved , the russians have tested a missile
on norway was to see a particular lichteffekt of unknown origin .
the russian defense , only yesterday has admitted that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the norwegian border .
the start , but not again was successful and the described as a type " bulava rocket , should be the originally the pride of the russian army , is beginning to the nightmare of the russian generals , as well as the prime minister vladimir putin .
also its repeated presence on the ground at the raketetest has had no positive effect on the success of the probeflüge .
bulava is usually not launched at all or in the air has been damaged .
in the russian newspapers , it is already on ' bulava ' as on a " missile , the not flying . "
not a rocket , the shining flies , but
this was already 13 attempt at the beginning of normal .
only again at the end of the flight are technical damage to the missile have emerged .
probably the engine exploded in the third raketenstufe .
this time launched ' bulava ' from the nuclear submarine dmitri donskij , under the the water of the white sea , .
this raketentyp allows the launch of the submarine - boat .
therefore , is probably that the mysterious caused by an unspecified fliegendes object light on nordwegen was actually the damaged ' bulava ' .
furthermore , the norwegians have for the first moment not doubt that it is a russian missile .
the generals has not clearly opposed this diesesmal and claims that we can talk of a failure .
the first two stages of the missile were not from and affected by the accident was only the third stage .
in the previous cases were damaged the engines straight in the first phase .
even if no teststart without mistake , holds the leadership of the ministry of defence only six of the thirteen for unsuccessful .
the almost 50 success met with optimism and so the generals will continue to say , therefore , that the " bulava " even without problems will be flying and even to ten hyperschall - nuclear warheads will bear with a weight of max . 1.15 tonnes .

czech discovery : a substance , even in the capitalism hiv viruses , tempered like steel capitalism
the team of czech and the german scientists testing , the new links should prevent the spread of hiv viruses in the body .
the main advantage of improved substance is that he also in the viruses , which are already resistant to medicines .
this fact outweigh against the disadvantage that the link in usual virus - variants is not so much , as one of the existing medicines .
the disease of aids can be cured not yet .
the patients can the medikamentenzusammenstellung but extend the life and the increase in the number of hiv viruses in body prevent .
but their use will be accompanied by a number of side - effects .
incomplete oppression of the virus reproduction , has also the development sg . resistentviren to result , against the no medicines are more effective .
the work of the three institutions of the academy of sciences cr experts , by the vscht ( both chemically - technological university ) prague and by the university in heidelberg opens the way in which we can deal with the virus - resistance .
you have shown that the substances referred to as metalokarborane act on the eiweißstoff , is the responsible for proliferation of the hiv viruses .
the metalokarborane are links on boron , hydrogen , carbon and cobalt .
these links block the virus reproduction , in other ways than all the medicinal products used today , therefore , they can overcome the resistance - problem .
in their work the scientists to new capitalism improved capitalism connections , on the basis of the knowledge of molekularmechanismus their commitment on the viruses - eiweißstoff were prepared .
the metalokarborane have a unique three - dimensional structure : two vielfächige cages , the from boron , hydrogen - and carbon - atoms , and by a metal - nuclear power , in this case cobalt , are linked .
heimtückisches and lasting virus
hiv protease is eiweißstoff of the hiv virus , the for the life cycle of the virus is essential .
without the hiv virus - caused by the hiv protease division would not tyres infektionsvirenpartikel arise .
if we eliminate the hiv protease tasks , we also in the body of the patients from the proliferation of the virus , explaining the scientists in the press release , by the institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry the academy of sciences cr has been issued .
in the work in the wissenschaftszeitung journal of medicinal chemistry was published , describing the scientists whole ranks of the links , in which two couples the cages ( see table ) are linked by a brief organic chain , the then continues systematically to be changed .
, but rather weaker reliable
the impact of this number of substances against the hiv - protease wurdne in a test tube tested , even against their constant ( resistant ) variants which have been won of hiv - infected patients .
the impact of the metalokarborane in the usual enzyme - variant is not so much , as in the medicines used clinically , however , will not lose their impact on the resistentvarianten , against the the medicines used are often ineffective .
the unique mechanism , as well as their further characteristics , such as the biological and chemical stability , low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical shaping , power metalokarboranen interesting links for further research , addressed to the development of effective medicines against hiv says pavlina rezacova , leader of the laboratories for strukturbiologie of the institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and of the institute for molecular genetics the academy of sciences .

the ods has left the chamber before the vote , it is also the wish of the government , because the amended budget is only a less bad version of the budgetprovisoriums . frase need clear

in accordance with the czech television has janota for monday registered after the government with the prime minister .
he has indicated that he be considered further remain in office .
reason to do so is his disappointment on the verhandugn of the budget .
the extent to which fishermen for the further battle with the budget deficit , so that , in accordance with necas the nominanten of the social democracy ( cssd ) , the amendments in the budget enforced , in the government had nothing to do .
the prime minister will also say clearly that he should resign , if parliament adopts continue to enhance deficit - laws , for example , the , concerning the sickness and pensions , or the dienstgesetzesnovelle .
topolanek : the nominated by ods ministers were wrong not
it is a matter of the prime minister , fishermen and the whole government .
the nominated by the ods ministers have not made mistakes , has stressed topolanek in a textmeldung from the united states .
it has mentioned that in some of the ministries in deputy function people sitting , the commit to top 09 , the voted against the budget .
necas stressed that , if fishermen darür decides , to the fight against the deficit - level of public finances to renounce , ' it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left - wing majority , which is currently in the parliament ' .
then it is supposedly with the support and civic tolerance can count not .
i have not thought about it , and if it will be now , then i shall be dealing with it , the nominated by the civil defence minister martin said bartak the journalists in parliament .
prime minister fishermen afternoon on the meeting of the european council flew to brussels .
the ods at the request of the prime minister resigned
at the same time , necas stressed that the ods probably on wednesday , in the house would vote against the amended budget , if the prime minister of the members of the civic would expressly ask that they enable the adoption of the budget .
we are not as orphans , then , we are not small children , so he responded to the question of whether the ods by their absence in the political negotiation on the budget of the leader of the party in parliament as well as in the czech republic has not been reduced .
i have not noticed that my vote would be lacking .
already renounced the mandate when i , i knew that it in next few months of the parliament and , above all , to bolshevism destruction everything would be positive , responded topolanek itself .

vaccination against pneumokokken free of charge and voluntarily
imfung against pneumokokken change from january the usual .
it should act as a first free of charge to the families and be voluntary .
but now are taking the vote that the duty - vaccination would be more effective .
the preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumokokken culminate .
the arzneiinstitut is already implementing the maximum prices of vaccines , have to pay for the health insurance .
the experts are also on the impfungsverfahren in the clear .
new vaccination
vaccines for free august - children
from january children can be vaccinated against pneumokokken free of charge , which were born and later on 2 august last year .
the condition st that they have not received any impfdosis yet .
who with the vaccination has already begun in last year or earlier , weiterewiederholungsimpfung itself must also pay .
the first impfdosis must be made between the 3 and 5 months old of the child .
already last year , a quarter of the families their children against pneumokokken vaccinate .
the parents paid 1600 kroner and more for a dose .
for the vaccination of the youngest children are four doses required .
in the whole , the experts estimate that the health insurance for the impfdosen spend sek 300 , 000 to 450 000 per year .
they save but in the treatment , which would need children without vaccination .
until now , the state has spent for all flächenimpfungen of children around 500 000 per year .
the obligation - vaccination was introduced with the so-called janota package .
pneumokokken mittelohrentzündung , but also cause serious infections including gehirnhautentzündungen and blutvergiftung .
by pneumokokkeninfektionen die with us for investigation per year up to 28 children in hospital in 10 years of age .
outside of the czech republic , the duty - vaccination of children against pneumokokken was introduced in some 40 countries .
the vaccination will be duty ?
at the same time it is said that this vaccination in future duty could be .
from january paid in by the insurance and that this should be voluntary .
mentioned , that the obligation - vaccination would be better , for example , the leader of the citizens ' nahlas , mr rudolf kalovsky .
its association is already long term for the pneumococcal vaccination .
the experts at the international conference , which has been involved in our union , were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination .
this is not very ideal .
on the other hand , we are glad that we have managed to enforce is , at least the .
i believe that this is the way ahead , we must go now , led kalovsky .
the ministry of health does not want to change but the impfverfahren against pneumokokken .
in this moment we consider the not at all , be vlastimil spokesman said sesen .
the voluntary vaccination has their disadvantages , claim the doctors .
the chairman of the practical fachgesellschaft paediatricians , hana cabrnochova , is that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks .
if all the children would be vaccinated , then we could reflect on the reduction of wiederholungsimpfungszahl ' in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive , we understand the political decision that this was launched vaccination as a voluntary , " says allerdingst cabrnochova .
the experts expect that more than 80 % of the parents their babies against pneumokokken inoculated from next year .
the vaccination against pneumokokken is path - breaking it is also that this will be paid for the first - of the health insurance and not by the state .
the insurance should spend the money for the prevention , so that save it for further treatment , erkärt cabrnochova .
the doctors have to buy the vaccines itself .
but that is a concern of the practical paediatricians , the concerns the purchase the vaccines .
according to the original plans should be the vaccines bought by the insurance and the doctors who receive this at the same way , as well as other vaccines issued by the state to you .
a number of members feared , however , that the insurance as ' the money from the krankenversicherungherausführen could ' .
the doctors buy the vaccines itself and will therefore have to wait until the insurance , you pay for them .
according to the estimates , the individual practical doctors will need to invest sek 40 000 per month , which is a significant amount of money .
this will not be easy , cabrnochova says .

the islam can be french ?
in a secular state , pluralism and pragmatism .
in a time for a ban on building in the swiss electorate voted in favour of minarets and the concern about the alleged islamisation of europe is widespread , john bowen , an american academics , has written a sound and thoughtful report on whether to muslims in one of the avowedly säkularisiertesten societies europe can be integrated -- and be integrated .
a number of readers will this new book from admiration for the last work of the author : ' why the french no headscarves love ' ( originaltitel : ' why the french don ' t like headscarves read ' ) ( 2006 ) , an elegant and densely argumentierenden study a contentious issue , the shared the country on one and a half decades and employees and their effects are still to today as well .
bowen 's neustes book offers a broader and kühneres range .
he not only , as a good anthropologist , would like to know what the politicians and the media , on the islam say in france , but what really happens in the area .
he has spent months in mosques , schools , and institutions , the now the 5 to 6 million muslims in france , as bowen calls it " islamic provide freedom ' .
it is a good listener , it is again debates between teachers and students about the issues , of most concern to you .
should a muslim in a mosque or a town hall marry ( or both ) ?
young muslims should be lectured on evolution and rights of homosexuals ?
can a muslim mrs marry a man non- ?
it is for a muslim , permissible to use a zinsorientiertes banking system , in order to get a mortgage ?
it is this seemingly mundane affairs gives , he claims , the daily life , in contrast to the political drama , the media .
the author , a new generation of imams acknowledges , teachers and intellectuals , none of them with a well - known behalf , possibly with the exception of tarik ramadan , a muslim - arab scholars and academics who was born in switzerland .
this new generation of trying to open up the debate on this , as it is possible , on the one hand , a good muslim and , on the other hand , a good citizens to be in a modern secular society .
they have not all arguments on their side .
the conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a french or european islam .
the thinkers and activists , questioned the bowen salafi with their counterparts , are often divided – advocates of the puristischen sunni islam , which in connection with saudi arabia – the today is a small but influential presence under europe muslims show .
bowen is of the opinion that muslim values could be compatible and french secularism .
however , an agreement requires a give and take on both sides .
it is to what extent french into political decision - makers ( and the intellectual elite , guarded the so passionate the separation of church and state ) really feel committed to pluralism .
it is a sign of that muslims may a rougher treatment as catholics , protestants and jews , the turn had to make their historic compromise with the secular republicanism .
it recognises a ' stricter werteschrauben ' rather than a growing pragmatism .
the islam can be french ? in the aftermath of the read this book , it is inclined to say ' yes , but not yet ' .
the trostloseste outlook of the world
the arctic is changing more quickly and in more dramatic than any other umweltregion on earth .
the ice is disappearing , the it marks , with an alarming rate and adopted lives that can survive anywhere else .

admiral nelsons meeting with a polar bears as brave 14 -year-old fähnrich to sea , the only with the rifle butts of his muskete fought , is certainly a myth , but others are true .
young bears , which have been caught , as they schwammen behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers , have been put in zoos and circuses .
a zirkusaufführung at the beginning of the twentieth century showed 75 polar bears in a vision .
even today zooanlagen still typically have a millionth of the environment of a wild alttiers . the climate is rarely suitable : the polar bear in singapore was absolutely by the green algae , which in the hollow hair grow his fur .

ironically , in the waters of the north of these two jagdnationen will remain the ice the longest .
in his new book ' after the ice ' ( originaltitel , " after the ice " ) offers alun anderson , a former editor of the wissenschaftsmagazins " new scientist ' , a clear and worrying description of the science of the arctic and , as a packenden insight into the future could develop .
not all the answers that scientists have .
neither atmosphärenwissenschaftler nor ozeanografen can explain the speed of appropriate changes .
this is not , however , to a lack of rationalisation .

sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to receive prices , but this is always been rejected .
the arrest of the american contractor will probably be the tensions between the communist government of the castro - brother in cuba and the obama government increase , the a " slow " rapprochement had sought to the improvement of relations with the island .
the news of the arrest of the new york times reported was first last friday .
the new us policy attaches importance to the fact that the united states to be a anything in return , if the cuban government concrete steps in this direction , such as release political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition .
mobile phones and notebooks are legally in cuba , although they are new and coveted products in a country , in which the average earnings of an government officials $ 15 per month .
since this year , the cuban government only allowed normal citizens the purchase of a mobile phone , they are used mainly for the dispatch of text messaging , because a 15 - minute exclusive telephone conversation would cost a day .

prüfungsdaten show persistent rassenkluft
the certificates to mathematikleistung were welcome last week good news for the public schools in washington d.c.
although the district of washington is still far behind the schools of the country , the produce excellence , the evidence show that the fourth and achtklässler faster progress than towns in the last two years , the atlanta , chicago and include new york , have made .
but what in the latest figures from the national assessment of the bildungsfortschritts ( national assessment of educational programme - including naep ) is , is the persistently leistungskluft between african - american and white pupils , both at local level , as well as national level .
the average scoring the white viertklässler from washington d.c. , in the last two years has risen by 262 to 270 ( on a range of 500 ) , the their african - american peers , but only rose by three points from 209 to 212 .
in reality , between 2007 and 2009 , the leistungskluft rose from 53 to 58 points .
the progress of the african - american basically remained constant achtklässler , he fell by a statistically significant point of 245 on 244 .
the average scoring white pupils was not included in the monitoring data , since the stichprobenumfang was not big enough .
the picture of a six - year period is also not encouraging .
the gap , which separated white and black viertklässler 2003 , as the first naep has been covered in this district , fraud 60 skalenpunkte ( 262 to 202 ) .
and although the points have achieved , the children of both groups , has grown in this period , has barely narrowed the difference with now 58 points .
last week some bildungsbefürworter of the district expressed their concern that the results of schulkanzlerin michelle example rhee and the democratic mayor adrian m. fenty was celebrated , on the largest part of white pupils , who are already powerful children , were pushed ahead .
this intimates that we the gesamtwertung by the treatment of those who have raised at the top end of the scale , which is difficult and problematic , jeff smith said , member of the board of dc voice , a nonprofit group for the bildungsgleichheit in washington dc .
i will not for a range of two or three points on and , down the democratic washington stadtratsmitglied , kwame r. brown said , the a daughter , in the fourth class of the eaton primary has .
brown , a frequent critics of the managementstils of rhee , said , the message the prüfungspunktzahlen is that the city the secondary need urgent attention .
of course you would like to always see the positive signs , i respect that .
but i am frightened , is that we are not close to spend time and energy , to which we for our mittelschule must use .
rhee said , the district of must continue to find better ways , in order to be to meet the needs of the leistungsschwachen pupils .
in this autumn , for example , will be some trained teachers to a new leselehrplan , the wilson - read - system , to use , the pupils in the upper classes of the primary and mittelschule which basic skills of the reading not at the start of their schullaufbahn have mastered and which are lagging behind significantly behind their peers classmates .
everyday mathematics , a curriculum , the from nursery school to the sixth class games and life experience in places the emphasis has been , under the former senior schulinspektor clifford janey be brought to washington and this curriculum , some of the naep - progress have been reported , attributed to the last week .
i believe that we must continue to work , the best measures to benefit the pupils , which are under the notenniveau , said rhee .
others say that the naep highlight - results of the question , whether rhee can continue to do so , to improve the performance of the system and will continue to the additional money and can provide the resources for the leistungsschwachen schools , which are necessary , in order to reduce the gap .
this is a serious dilemma for michelle rhee , bruce fuller said , a professor of education to the university of california at berkeley , of the urban audit work .
the conventional cure is , and management reforms its resources on the schools , which are in the poorest areas of washington , dc .
the objective could create political aftermath , the work against this important item on the agenda .
the weak point is of course , as in other urban schulinspektoren that they are trying to keep the white and black middle class .
our focus is to ensure that we set up a system a great schools .
we must strengthen our schools in the areas , so that all families , regardless of where they live , can be sure that their children an excellent public receive education can .
janey , the now schulinspektor in newark , is , in an interview this week said that one of the most important elements to the closure of the leistungskluft is , the traditional public school year , and at the moment that in washington around 180 days , to extend , in order to compete with the charter schools .
we must increase the school year to nearly 200 days , in order to have the strength to change , janey said , the last year with its teachers to an agreement on 185 days per year , the he as " a milestone ' on the road to a greater increase in the next treaty .
university education for more people than future
the coach achieved the gettysburg - college , with a resounding pipes .
graciela rodriguez , 12 , rising from and blinzelt a moment at the sight of the white pillars , ziegelsteinfassaden and of the smaragdgrünen turf .
gracielas parents have little to the end of the high school diploma was sufficient in el salvador .
until recently had also graciela , which has been recovered in silver spring and now lives in riverdale , never set foot on a college campuses .
its attitude and the other achtklässler the group , to explore the gettysburg , where the teaching costs usd 38.690 per year , was the a ehrfurchtsvollen visitor , rather than that of the enthusiastic future students .
' yes ! here , i will soon be ! ' , called graciela , who would like to study medicine , as the leader announced that they had now for science enter the building .
" wow , really ? " she said to food for thought , as the low professor - to - school students ratio was reported .
the college in pennsylvania was the 7 , which the children on their three - day tour have visited and now they have the intended message : the question is not included in full , whether we are going to the college .
the question is , where .
on the one hand , there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the united states hispanischer immigrants , what the high school diploma was sufficient not end or as a teenager become pregnant , on the other hand , there are also , however , hundreds of thousands of which the collegeausbildung received , which is necessary in the middle class , in order .
in truth , one of five of these ' second generation of hispanoamerikaner " the college – what is a remarkable achievement , since many of their immigrant parents , most came from mexico and central america , in the united states , without to have completed the high school diploma was sufficient .
your success stories are important , researchers , because they say for a generation , which play a huge role in the labor force of the country will show , the way forward .
, assess the powerful children , those who say that this often have a natural affinity for school and inherent in them a boost to success .
many of you have also parents to set high targets , the their children and to find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with american schools .
but beratungsprogramme also play a major role , by they graciela and millions of children as they help in college to come , especially if these efforts continue on a long period of time .
if we regarded low - income children whose parents have not the experience and skills to help them in the wegsuche by the system , then a single measure at any time will not solve the problem either , patricia gándara said , a researcher at the university of california , davis , and the hispanoamerikanische students examined .
we must think about , for these children a supportive network of pre- school up by the high school diploma was sufficient available .
the bundesprogramm , had financed the tour gracielas college , is a useful example .
it is known as the gear up a gear - and is more than $ 300 million per year available for local school systems , in order to launch , the college - vorbereitungsprogramme begin , if low - income pupils in the mittelschule are continuing and , until you have completed the high school diploma was sufficient .
in accordance with the us department for education the programme has since 1999 helped more than 10 million pupils , 60 % of whom more than in college are gone .

us defense gates : iran must reckon with additional sanctions
friday defense robert m. gates said that the world powers will soon be " significant " on iran be impose additional sanctions , because he has not taken part in discussions on its nuclear .
gates spoke during a 7 - days visit by the war zones in afghanistan , and in the iraq to a group of approximately 300 us soldiers in northern iraq and the prospect of a military action against played down the islamic republic of iran .
in iran are no good opportunities for election , he said in response to the question of soldiers the likelihood of such a development .
' one of the things that are on the soul to me , is that if we in the last six years have learned something from the iraq , the the war own unpredictability . "
the obama government prefers a sanktionspaket in recital , which aims at iran 's political and military elite , but also the gates has announced that some sanctions durchschnittsiraner might affect .
he said that a " package of positive incentives and disincentives ' is necessary to ' in order to convince the iranian government that , in reality , they with nuclear arms is less protected ' , because " their people monsters ' will suffer under the sanctions .

the us government has pushed for this type of agreement , in order to build the trust between the two parties and time for negotiations to gain .
iran appears but since this time the negotiations have to rely on the provisional agreement -- partly , experts say , because the iranian leadership is divided about , whether they should commit themselves to the united states .
iran that the international community in relation to a number of proposals to which they had already been agreed in early october , simply left , has , frankly , the international community , including the russians and chinese , to put together a way , as it in connection with important additional sanctions for iran have never been , gates said .

in a statement made in new york has condemned the iranian representation in the united nations , what you on thursday ' groundless assertions ' without and foundation of certain members of the security council to the iranian atomaktivitäten called and said that they are prepared , the talks to continue with the united states and five other world powers , ' in order to achieve a suitable long- term solution ' .
gates , should the to return to washington last friday , met on tomorrow , with iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki , before it in the oil - rich kurdish region in the iraq to take part in meetings with the soldiers in kirkuk and with the kurdish authorities in irbil flew .
the tensions between the kurds and the arab majority in the iraq are still high , in particular in relation to borders , property rights , and because the distribution of public revenues .
gates urged both sides , to reduce the potential for conflict , in order to prevent delays of the us plans , the american troops , up until the end of august of 115 000 to 50 , 000 to reduce .
gates also sought , to dispel the kurdish concern on the forthcoming a withdrawal of troops . us representatives to masood barzani , quoted gates , the president of the kurdish regional government , has said : ' we will their security , prosperity and their autonomy within a united iraq .
we will not leave it ' .
a change of direction in the ageing china
wang weijia and her husband grew surrounded by propagandaplakaten on , the ' mother earth to you considered that lectures , that is tired , in order to maintain ' and ' a further children baby more means a grave more ' .
these lessons have you learned is that , than government officials so well in shanghai , and the by the low birth rate , and the ageing population in this summer , suddenly , began to change the course and young couples ermunterten , more than to have a child , their response immediately and finally was : ' in no case ' .
we have already invested all of our time and energy in a child .
is nothing left for a second child , wang , 31 , said a personalleiterin with an 8 - month old son .
more than 30 years after the introduction of the a - child policy in china , the two generations of notoriously dicklichen , verzogenen einzelkindern , be called the affectionately ' small emperor ' , has produced , is a bevölkerungskrise in the country .
the average birth rate is to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 entered into force at the time that this policy , fallen , the un
department for population , while the number of the population of 60 years and older in the year 2020 by enjoys 16.7 % of the population to 31,1 % by the year 2050 will increase exponentially . this is far on the global average of around 20 % .
the imbalance is with educated population in rich coastal cities , like shanghai , more .
last year have 60 - year - olds and older almost 22 % of the reported residents shanghai , identified , while the birth rate under a child has been a per - couple .
zhenhua lingli , leader of the shanghai stadtbevölkerungs - and familienplanungskomission has said that couples in the normal reproductive age babies must be given , in order to help ' , the relationship to reduce the ageing population and the labour force of the future to alleviate ' .
shanghai will soon be ' -- but not so rich -- as old as the industrialised countries , such as japan and sweden , be , ' she said .
a gradual easing
in the country 's constitution in 1978 enshrined , china 's one- child policy will probably be the most controversial disposal , which was introduced by the ruling communist party until today .
couples , which are in breach of this policy , must reckon with huge fines -- up to its triple annual in some regions -- and with discrimination in their work .
chinese staatsvertreter attributed to have this policy is that the critical demands of the natural landesressourcen could be avoided , while human rights abuses in the enforcement of the policy have condemned .
in rural regions have a number of officials , pregnant women , the already had a child , forced abortion .
many couples had also geschlechtsselektive abortions carried out , which was a unnatural balance of women to men .
in the past years , officials have for population is gradually moderated their attitude to the a - child policy .
2004 , they have allowed for more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers , members of ethnic minorities and cases , in which both husband and wife have been einzelkinder -- and 2007 was the tone many hard moderated slogans .
qiao xiaochun , a professor at the institute for bevölkerungsforschung the university of beijing , said that officials have recently discussed even on radical amendments , for example , couples to allow two children , in which a partners einzelkind is .
shanghai , was the first chinese city in july , which has launched a aggressive campaign to promote more births .
posters , the families belehrten , only to have a child , almost overnight of directives have been replaced , which describe in detail , who for a second child into question is and how we can apply for the authorisation .
the town hall has urban employees and voluntary sent for family planning , couples at home and among the doors durchzuschieben fact sheets .
you also asked , psychological and financial advice to the available to the more than have a child .
the response was not encouraging , familienplanungsvertreter said .
disappointing response
although officials from a rural town in the shanghai außenbereichen of said , that a recovery in the applications of couples to recognise is that after the launch of the campaign against a wish to second child , the urban districts report no change .
in the community of huinan with a population of as an example still go up 115 000 per month only four to five requests .
disappointed shanghai officials say that the expected for 2010 number of births in the city still despite the campaign in approximately 165,000 will be -- a little higher than in 2009 , but lower than in 2008 .
feng juying , leader of the familienplanungskomitees of the shanghai community caolu , said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children .
they want to give their first the best , she said .
yang jiawei , 27 , and his wife , liu juanjuan , 26 , said that they would like to have two children , and this is also legally allowed .
but they have , such as many chinese , only a minor sick and life insurance , the government .
without a social network , they say , this decision would be irresponsible .
people in the west assess the a - child policy falsely as a question of human rights , yang , a certain construction engineer , whose mrs said in the seventh month with their first child is pregnant .
indeed , it is robbing us the opportunity to have more than a child .
but the problem is not simply in a policy .
the problem is money .
other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitate .
wang , the personalleiterin , has said that it would just like to a child , because it was also a einzelkind . ' we have been the centre of the family and used that each of us has been .
we are not accustomed to us to deal with other and do this also not really want to . '
chen zijian , a 42 - year old , which the übersetzungsunternehmen belongs , said it plain .
for parents from the medium- sized enterprises with doppelkarriere , by the the birth rate is falling , he said , revolves around is to be a success and that we must be selfish .
the today , 20 - 39 - year - olds age group , so that on their parents grew during the early days of the chinese kapitalismusexperiments fight and they want to see no way a life for themselves , he said .
also , a single child he said , makes huge demands to the time of the parents .
a mother must abandon their social life at least for two years .
then there is the raumfrage -- " we must rebuild his home ' -- and the life -- " if the child 9 months old , it is already have to have a curriculum vitae facilities for the best nursery schools ' .
most of his friends are prepared , this a time of trouble , chen said , but not two time .
our generation is the first , the has achieved a higher standard of living , he said .
we want to bring not too many victims .
un group drawing up plan to reduce emissions
the fed by the un climate conference -- which up to now characterised by wild poznań and mutual accusations -- has on friday , publication of a document again be a priority , the for the next 40 years recording an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases , with the industrialized countries in the near future the greatest burden shoulders to .
the text , the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases could provide , has displayed both the remaining obstacles , as also shown the way forward .
but it has been seen as an important progress in a negotiation , the time is assuming , since more than 100 leaders from all world next week will arrive in copenhagen .
the text , the un working group established by a special was formulated , is silent on the money supply from , the rich countries of the poor countries that should be so that these short and long term can meet the global warming .
it also provides a range of options for the key issues , including such as industry and large emerging - market economies can restrict their carbon - emitting and how high the upper limit value of the global temperature increase should be , the political decision - makers would support .
the process will be given a great deal of flexibility , as john coequyt , a senior representative of the sierra clubs in washington .
michael zammit cutajar , of the six pages of document has drafted , has summed up a 180 sides long negotiations , in order to , which is what the in the heart of the leading klimaschutzvertreter of the un , ivo de boer , has described as " the great whole ' .
it shows the footprint of a possible agreement , in what the industrial nations together their emissions by 25 % to 45 per cent by 2020 , compared with the limit values in 1990 , would reduce , while major developing countries , their emissions would reduce by 15 to 30 % in the same period .
together , the countries could reduce the emissions by 50 % and 95 % by 2050 .
the european community has the talks on friday also a given to boost by your assurance on the next three years $ 3.6 billion per year , in order to help poorer countries , adapt to the effects of climate change - from the face of the floods , droughts and avoiding deforestation .
nevertheless , the friday , the same verbal fireworks , which the discussions in the last week had intended .
the american klimasonderbeauftragte envoy todd stern began has rejected wording , the binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in industrialised countries , compared with voluntary reductions demand for greater emerging economies , if this will not be financed from the developed countries .
this train has announced that the obama government a tougher line with china , as the representative of the bush government is , not even two years ago .
the united states will not sign up to an agreement , without any significant emerging countries stand up and take action , so stern , also the lamented the fact that the text does not go far enough , ensure that the reductions also outside it could be confirmed .
stern was a deputy hour after the declaration of the chinese secretary of state its opinion he yafei , the stated that it was the leading american klimaunterhändler either lacks ' of common sense ' or ' it was highly irresponsible " of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the united states would not financially assist china to meet the global warming .
by the fact that the future economic direction of the great world powers is at stake , both within the developed countries , as also opened up between the developed countries and the emerging economies fault lines .
the current fight refers also to the rescue of individual economies , as well as to the rescue of the planet , with china and the united states , because of their respective commitments squabbles , while poorer countries say that the two dozen most influential countries , ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps .
ricardo ulate , a delegate from costa rica , said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting , who should bear the costs for the bremsung of the greenhouse gas emissions , because even the countries affected have begun to proceed , aggressive in making , the countries with very high treibhausgasabgabe to account for their actions .
it is clear that this is a game , which will develop a new economic dominance , so ulate , as the regional is klimawandelberater working for conservation internationally in mexico and central america .
some of the countries that are the most exposed to the effects of climate change , said that they would continue to fight on a legally binding treaty in copenhagen , although the leading participants to say that the discussions in the best - case scenario will lead to a political agreement .
the alliance of small island states with 43 members , in the early friday morning has produced a 24 - page draft treaty .
artur runge - butcher , who is leading the international climate negotiations for the european commission , has said , that the offensive of small island states ' political pressure on the whole political process , " partly that is why , because now they are united and measures of the emerging countries , such as china and india , are calling for .
the talks , got a new urgency , as the delegates have focused on the fact that , most of the open questions still to the arrival of the government leaders need to be resolved , in order to come to an agreement .
's high - level representatives , as the indian minister of the environment minister , jairam ramesh , and the chinese vice - minister entstiegen its aircraft and around through the corridors of the bella centre to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to claims posts , which will be negotiated during the next week .
the pure -- 13 000 people are on a daily basis in the extent of the assembly kongresszentrum a and from , organise gitarrespielende activists shows at night , in which they are making fun of on the countries which , betray your opinion , and sell , and draft treaty will be passed on from hand to hand rather than by e-mail -- is already a challenge .
the intensity builds just on : almost all the important ministers are here now and from wednesday 60 government leaders will be in copenhagen .
we shall now proceed to the oberliga , said carlos manuel rodriguez , vice - president for global policy of organisation conservation internationally .
the heavyweights come .
britain 's first 225 km / h faster train defines the montagsgefühl new
on monday morning at 5 in the 13 will penetrate the darkness , in order to announce a zugabfahrt a pipe , which is a revolution in transport in the united kingdom .
the first hochgeschwindigkeitspendlerzug in the country is in its blitzfahrt of ashfort , kent , after the london st pancras 225 km / h achieve and 93 km in 38 minutes to go .
to lord adonis , the transport ministers , will then lady kelly holmes , drawn up on board of the first javelin pendlerservices from london .
he hopes , that the new service united kingdom , finally , to an international rail network quicker , more reliable trains ankoppeln will and the major urban areas of the midlands , and of the north of scotland to london coast will .
the neglected province could be to living pendlerstädten , arbeitsanfahrtszeiten would be radically reduced and the switch from aircraft and car to the railways would national carbon emissions and reduce the congestion on the roads .
in theory believe the three large parties in this vision .
but the british pound , the many billion are needed for the construction of a new national network , the inevitable planungsschlacht and fears about environmental damage could in the british hochgeschwindigkeitsgleisen still the brakes .
high speed two ( hs2 ) , a company in january , the government is to present a viability study , will lord adonis deliver according to the times , the report on 30 december .
this would give it a detailed streckenkarte the next stage of the high - speed rail network .
the new railway line , the london with is to link the west midlands , with a margin of five metres will pass to urban areas and in places , where the impact on the environment are controversial .
in the free movement of terrain , the plan will the concept within a gap of 25 metres from the final route .
hs2 should also three options for a greater , northwards leading produce high - speed rail network .
lord adonis will respond in the spring .
the preferred option proposed is a y - shaped routing , in which a single high - speed link would lead in the west midlands .
the route would are in , or in the vicinity of birmingham parts and a abzweig would lead west of the pennines to manchester and scotland and the other in the direction of north - east after sheffield , leeds and newcastle upon tyne .
a single line would lead to scotland .
" it appears to be the most effective option , " a rail insider said .
after the completion , the journeys would reduce between london and edinburgh to 2 hours 40 minutes .
the first section , which would not be opened in 2025 , would allow the travellers , the london - birmingham route in 49 minutes today , compared with just over one hour , to go .
the drafts , with a speed of the trains are offering the opportunity to travel 400 km / h , which the british rail network would be the fastest of europe .
the first line has been planned , so that 400 metres long trains can operate with a maximalkapazität of 1.100 people point .
up to 18 trains per hour on the london - route birmingham could be in operation .
this would mean that a terminus in london would be necessary , could be done on the travellers 20,000 per hour .
in view of the spatial restrictions in the capital , is expected that a existing railway station would be extended to the high - speed network .
bahnexperten say that only st pancras internationally or euston have this potential .
lord adonis will be aware , whether or not this plan its opinion should be continued , but the lengthy public consultancy and planning mean that a final decision will be taken only after the parliamentary elections .
even if the wheels in motion , however , it is , in sections of the network must be built .
the trains should first of all the high - speed lines to existing railway lines in the north of birmingham change , which the route between london and scotland would be to continue over three hours .
this is a crucial sticking point , so that a shift from air to rail can be ensured , a beacon for the schienenrevolution .

last night , when he was asked about the increased mortgage , duncan : " this was said by both the fees office , as well as point following legg to value have been approved . "

the union for french democracy ( udf ) vigorously and calls for the party nouveau centre on , not to use more their seals
the parties , which will be supervised by françois bayrou 's party modem , when a takeover on friday of the siegels has , of the once set up by valéry giscard d'estaing party , on the part of the chairman of the party nouveau centre , mr hervé morin , strong reaction and urged him under threat of a judicial persecution , to use this document stamp on any more .
mr hervé morin announces publicly his intention , to take this udf seals , since it is of the opinion that not worthy françois bayrou would be to defend this political legacy , after he had a hand to the left .
the minister of defense , whose parteipartner the ump is , incidentally , wanted to this strategy before the national council of the nc to reaffirm on saturday .
on the strength of his efforts he had the support of the members mr hervé de charette ( former ump , now received in nc ) , with the right to the property of the brand udf , since it as a first 2004 this mark of the ' institute national de la propriété industrial ' has requested .
however , the geschäftstelle collapsed of françois bayrou 's friends supervised alliance udf , led the silence and clearly gave to understand that they could not expropriate , and the minister , and to the members under the threat of a judicial persecution to use a deadline , not more this seals and their to be transferred to the property rights of the brand .
you have made in the last days many statements that you would propose their political movement , take the udf siegelzu + + , wrote the parties , in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 büromitglieder , including françois bayrou and mrs de sarnez , of the modem party and the senator jean arthuis of the centrist alliance .
they believed that they have the right , the name , i believe , this movement + + + nouveau centre , the slogans of today 's udf + , on their political material , as well as possible to be on the start of their website .
as you know , you have no entitled to the use of this siegels , declared the secretariat of the udf , and calls on the party nc ' immediately the reference to the name udf from sämtlichem material , as well as by ( its ) website to remove ' .
also we called for by mr hervé de charette , " the property rights of the be transferred to their legal anspruchsberechtigen ' brand .
if you deny this , we will be complaint against they impose , in order to give the law , respect for and in order to defend the legitimate rights of the udf members , warned the undersigned .
in her letter you stress that ' udf ' since 1978 is a fully - fledged political movement and would remind you that morin and its friends " have made the choice ' to leave this 2007 , in order to create a competing movement , as has already been done by other 2002 had , in order to create the party ' ump ' .
the party nouveau centre has therefore , according to the undersigned , of any rights , the udf label ( union pour la démocratie française ) to use .
they continue to recall that the last congress of the udf , led to three - year accession to the modem party in 2007 and the creation of a secretariat for the defence ' of material and moral interests " of the set up by valéry giscard d'estaing movement , has adopted .
what mr hervé de charette is concerned , the secretariat , is continued , " he was at the time , when he has asked for the brand name , for three years now no longer a member of the udf ' , but the ump .
he benefited on scandalous and fraudulent way , by the lack of the deposit of acronym udf , in order to implement this for themselves .
they continue to be on the best ways to bear in mind that this recklessness is to turn in a criminal offence , and ironisieren the strategy of nc : ' it appears to us , but in the policy , as well as in the life dignified , themselves to make a name , rather than to try to come from the anonymity , it is , in fraudulent way appropriates a name , has to be no legal rights ' .

no one has the right , to act on their behalf ' , the representative of the public prosecutor , marie - christine daubigney confirmed .
the court of justice has now decided to make a judgment , after the process on the admissibility of mme bettencourt - meyers has taken place .
revolution managers or the end of the strategic frühaufklärung ?
if nothing changes in the leadership of the great french enterprises has our fight for the development of the economic intelligence ... in vain
for over a decade ago , the attitude of the management of large companies in terms of its staff , the position of the said companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution : it is the best intended for the personnel join ' values ' , as it was earlier on the consumer - products of the technicians in the work to impose shaped .
by it to customers in the centre of the companies , the marketing revolution the strategies of the conquest of the markets in the place given ... although the authoritarian temptation products separately factors preferences of the customers to impose regularly again !
the demobilisation of staff can lead to a lethal demoralisation .
the suicides in france telecom , psa or renault are only the tip of a much wider phenomenon , that , in particular , the employees affected .
this demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company from , in particular those of r & eund , which is even more crucial , to those of the economic intelligence .
in fact calls for the iu ( intelligence economique = economic intelligence ' ) of all the parties involved ( ... ) , is a proactive action and a future vision ' ; it claims by the staff a use , the entirely disagree with the instructions of the authoritarian management .
this is why we are calling for a occupational revolution , which would involve , the employees in denmittelpunkt the concerns of the company on an equal footing alongside the customers .
the very conditional use internal opinion polls
are the internal opinion polls , as the questionnaire , the orange has presented its wage earners , encourage this revolution in regard to the management - practice ?
unfortunately , i am afraid not .
- firstly , because i was able to establish that the whole fabric in the face of a new situation after many roundabout way finally priority concerned , the , ... to do what it has always done .
also because the authoritarianism , one of the pathology of power - increases proportional to the importance of his own failures .
and , finally , because most leaders have a simplistic idea by the human behavior .
emerged from the large ingenieurschulen is your interpretation of the psychology mechanistic .
you take by intellectuals comfort the old behavioristische theory , the recently by the us - american " neuroscience " revived unwittingly , far - reaching and of research institutes and has been spread by the media .
therefore , and by you suggested that it is possible , the ' lever " ( sic ) to the commitment of employees to work , encouraged a survey published aktuellein le figaro.fr of ipsos the executives in a position to a mechanistic governance system , which is not suitable for today 's world .
the mobilisierungsfaktoren identify and measure
instead , a for the smooth functioning of the modern companies need occupational revolution of the adoption of a final view of human behavior .
it is , in any consideration to integrate or practice of managing a fundamental minutes : for the wage is the commitment for the company will only be possible , if it appears clear as a means , in order to make a part of their dreams , their ambition to implement and their projects .
at the moment accept only the studies from the analysis multifunctional this idea of the motivation of the staff .
these studies have shown that they doxa laid down their businesses at the basis of a judge , the by their perceived picture of the company allowed you to assess what it offers them to achieve their life .
thanks to the identification and of the measurement of these mobilisierungsfaktoren can the leaders of the companies ' control their " social performance and their human resource management , predict and pre- empt again in the right place .
so , you will create a fertile ground , for the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence is favourable .

the new york times is of the opinion that obama " the necessary discourse proclaimed " and called his speech at the same time ' as ' bleak and exemplary .

turkish constitutional court resolves pro- kurdish party . decision with serious consequences
the turkish constitutional court on friday was the dissolution of the country 's pro- kurdish principal party known ; a decision , to the immediately raging demonstrations in the kurdish community in the south - east of the country , and in istanbul followed .
this decision , the work of the government is threatening to make enormous more difficult , who are trying to extend the hand , the kurdish community , in order to bring an end to the since 25 years of conflict .
the ' for ' a democratic society party ( dtp ) has been dissolved , because they had become a " site for the activities , the for the independence of the state and its indissoluble unity are bad , " the president of the constitutional court hasim kiliç four days after the decision to the press .
according to kiliç would be the decision of 11 judges getroffenworden unanimously , with a majority of seven votes would have been necessary in order to impose the break - up . he also pointed out that 37 of the party leaders , including the chairman ahmet türk and the parliamentarian aysel tugluk , for the duration of five years ago were excluded from the political events .
the judge of the further announced the waiver of parliamentary immunity , the türk and tugluk enjoy the party , as well as the confiscation of goods .
the dtp in parliament ( now has 21 seats of 550 ) .
the parteiführenden spoke before the decision to the effect that the parliamentarians would leave parliament rather than as parteilose to meet parliamentarians .
the decision followed a in the year 2007 by the prosecutor of the turkish bundesgerichts abdurrahman yalçinkaya initiated procedures . he accused the dtp , the " instructions " to follow the kurdistan workers ' party ( pkk ) , by ankara and the many other countries will be seen as a terrorist organisation .
many observers believe that the dtp is the legal political showcase the pkk - rebels .
the party to have assured , ' no link ' to the pkk , but refuses to call this as a terrorist organisation and calls to negotiations on the government .

' turkey can this ( kurdish , anm. that not resolve editorial ) question on the basis of the ban a party , " he told of the press .
the government , consisting of a party , which has emerged from the islamist movement , regretted the decision also .
" we oppose from principle against the closure of the parties .

this decision is a torpedoing of the " democratic opening up , has been the promoted by the government , " the political marktbeobachter ahmet island .
" you can clearly on a " response of the pkk , adds it .
on thursday , the pkk to an attack , in the three days before seven soldiers have died in the north of turkey . it was one of the most brutal attacks in the last months .
can the schneeeinbruch come
a properly knackigen winter , it is , what is wolfgang brauburger wishes .
not because it wants to bully the citizen , says the winterdienstleiter the fes .
but , so that its staff the whole of the vehicle technology can learn try and control .
at the weekend might be so far it according to the weather forecast for the first time .
more than 330 staff and 120 vehicles are prepared to take care of , in order to snow and ice .
this is the fes after a precise plan .
as soon as it in frankfurt snow cover and the level zero temperatures , 20 will have the so-called a - routes with großstreufahrzeugen boat , brauburger explained to us .
this includes some hauptverkehrs and transit such as the new way and the hanauer roads .
but also feuerwehrzufahrten , public local passenger transport routes , with differences , such as the atzelbergstraße pedestrian avenues and routes .
at three o'clock in the service of the fes begins morning
the around 1040 kilometres in needs in a maximum of three hours should , with feuchtsalz is responsible , the better , be spread more .
therefore the fes starts at three p.m. at night of , ' so that the routes are free , until the launching berufsverkehr ' .
it will be difficult , if it only at 7.30 in snow .
then we have a problem , the winterdienstleiter says , " because no one then , is prepared to make the streufahrzeugen place ' .
only then , so there is not further snowing , feed - and are erschließungsstraßen , including the council - beil - road , in the number .
the final priority have sides - and roads .
there will be complaints there , know brauburger .
at five o'clock in the morning is many battalions at your disposal of the fes on the way , gefahrenpunkte and crossings are removed as a priority .
the fes are usually in order to all of the cycle paths might not be concerned about .
there is a particular in frankfurt , of 22 until 4.30 p.m. , above all the bridges in the watchful eye , says brauburger .
since it would give to glätte is quickly on this , as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees , which streuer .
this will also be called by the police , if need be .
the cradle of dinosaurs
tawa hallae saw from as many other fleischfressende dinosaurs : the two metres long and 1.50 metres had a major animal expired on two strong hinterbeinen , other than a länglichen skull with sharp , gebogenen teeth , short poor with sichelkrallen and a long tail .
lived would have provided the kind of a few million years later , it would be nothing special .
but tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these körpermerkmalen sterling , nesbitt , reports of the university of texas in austin and colleagues in the magazine science on thursday .
the animal were living in today 's new mexico around 215 million years ago , the then in a dry area of superkontinents pangäa was around the equator .
tawa opened a new window on the early stages of the evolution of dinosaurs , says , nesbitt .
it shows us a lot about the relationships , the spread and the features of the early dinosaurs .
2006 began , nesbitt and other paleontologist with a grabung on in the north of the ghost ranch new mexicos .
we have sometimes found a dozen bones of dinosaurs in a day , which is unprecedented for deposits from the i reported team - member randall irmis by the utah museum of natural history .
the researchers quickly as new identified some of the bones .
in the course of the ausgrabung they played the remains of a total of five individuals together .
fund confirmed theories on dino - frühgeschichte
the name ' tawa ' comes from the sun of the hopi - indians .
it is an exceptional fund : " for sterling , nesbitt dinosaurs from the i - fossils are extremely rare , it is usually only individual fragments . "
other experts share the enthusiasm of dinosaurs not necessarily .
this fund is not particularly spectacular , but he confirmed some theories on the frühgeschichte the dinosaurs , says about martin sander , of the university of bonn .
according to the current doctrine , the dinosaurs for the first time in around 230 million years ago .
many of the oldest fossils but incomplete , which is why the allocation is this ur - dinos often controversial .
so , the experts , for example , debating when the echsen aufspalteten in their three main lines of development : the carnivorous theropoden , to which later the tyrannosaurus on external economic relations , the velociraptor and also the birds , known as the ' langhälse ' vierbeinigen sauropoden and their relatives , and the plant - eating ornithischia ( vogelbeckensaurier ) , to which , for example , the species triceratops and stegosaurus were .
after the analysis of , nesbitt and his colleagues is tawa hallae a original theropode .
it is an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties , says , nesbitt .
other than the skull of tawa hallae found the researchers , for example , references to luftsäcke , as you have also , the descendants of theropoden , the birds , .
thanks to the luftsäcke is breathing of birds more effective than the of mammals .
in tawa hallae were also the bones of the vertebral column seems partly with air filled .
tawa is the oldest and most savage theropode with luftsäcken , randall irmis says .
since the relatives of the line of huge sauropoden also later luftsäcke and lighter - bones , probably already was the common vorfahre both groups this useful innovation produced .
at least three waves of migration after north america
because the dinosaurs primitive have known so far had lived in south america , conclude the researchers that the echsen there appeared for the first time .
therefore early separated the three lines of development and spread of south america on all continents , the at the time still as superkontinent pangäa formed one landmass .
speaking for the fact that , together with the team tawa hallae the remains of two further , not particularly closely related theropoden was .
the three can not of a common ancestor , immigrants , the researchers argue .
we believe that there were at least three waves of migration after north america , says , alan turner mentioned by the american museum of natural history in new york , a co- author of the science study .
however , there are also contradictions .
an even older kind , silesaurus , the belongs to a schwestergruppe the dinosaurs , lived in poland , the bonn paläontologe martin mrs sander says today .
his opinion , a distorted picture , because in south america might simply particularly many primitive dino - fossils are preserved , while little is to be found in other continents .
as it created the dinosaurs , from a relatively rare to the sidelines of the reptilienstamms dominant landwirbeltieren of erdmittelalters to develop , is still puzzling .
during the the dinosaurs i shared their habitat , with many other reptiles , for example with the ancestors of today 's crocodiles and the flugsaurier and with a number of other echsen .
at the end of the i spread the dinosaurs from all over the world and developed many new species , while the affinities ausstarb on the border of the i of the law .
success story was not going to last forever
there are two hypotheses , in order to explain this change , says martin sander , .
it may have given a massacre , which survived the dinosaurs happen , but not the other reptiles .
or the dinosaurs were better adapted , so that they were able to beat the competition from the field .
the success story was certainly not going to last forever .
helped 150 million years later a meteorite impact of a group of animals to flourish , which are also already in the i entwickeltet , and has had , since then , a shadowy existence times : the mammals .
solidarity from vienna to são paulo
the list is long and the signatories are internationally .
university professors are toronto , the point , the university of cambridge uni vienna or from berkeley in california .
lecturers from naples are , from quebec , edinburgh , new york , são paulo or bremen , berlin .

uni - president werner müller - estler had the occupied by students and lecturers in the bildungsstreik buildings in the last week were spaces , because walls and daubed with paint works of art .
five students being injured .
the acts of vandalism , judging the signatories , justified not " the violent break - up of their own lectures by students and teachers by a polizeikommando ' .
the evacuation , a " not acceptable interference ' in the freedom of research and teaching .
the exclusive focus on vandalism serve ' the deligitimierung and criminalisation of protest ' and would like to draw from the content .
the bureau has deprived of the necessary discourse .
the lecturers demand the immediate cessation of criminal persecution .
the majority of the occupying forces did not support the damage , it says .
protest legitimacy
the trade union , mr verdi , also the young people and the german solidarity trade union confederation , with the students .
the protest is legitimate expression of a growing concern about the their own future , says verdi - landesjugendsekretär alexander small .

we are grateful to the unipräsidenten .
destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable instances of funds , as you said in a current hour on thursday in the wiesbadener landtag .
we have understanding for the protest , but no understanding for vandalism , so the cdu - landtagsabgeordnete peter beuth .
different saw the the oppositionsfraktionen spd , of the greens and the left .
the cdu , bemalte walls on the pretext , in order to criminalise the protest , said janine wissler ( left ) .
rather than to deal with the arguments and demands of the students , have been removed .
the left has tabled a motion , which calls on the home affairs ministers , to give report on the police action .
new silicon - valley
long years has been regarded as secret city , for western visitors inaccessible .
the capital moscow selenograd , one of ten districts , in the soviet union was a tough location for secret defence research .
today , the community with its 216 000 inhabitants , 37 kilometres from the moscow centre , as a " russian silicon valley ' .
significant research and production for micro - and so than nanoelectronics are .
already since september 2008 , representatives had selenograds contacts to frankfurt wissenschaftsstandort riedberg - linked with the uniinstituten and the firms of frankfurt innovation centre ( fiz ) .
there have been several mutual visits and now selenograd signed on wednesday and riedberg in frankfurt , a " protocol on closer cooperation ' .
the vice - moscow mayor yuri rosljak and prefect anatoly smirnov of selenograd led to the russian delegation , for frankfurt signed planungsdezernent edwin black .
2010 will be representatives of the fiz small and medium- sized enterprises and of the science foschungsschwerpunkts for a seminar after selenograd travel .
scientific exchange
it is about a continuous scientific exchange .
but it is also about economic relations .
companies of the fiz will make it possible , to gain a foothold in the growing russian market .
the other way round to russian wissenschaftsfirmen orders in germany scrape together .
selenograd is the seat major russian research institutes and businesses .
for example , these include the moscow institute elektronentechnik , the big companies sitronics and rosssijskaja elektronika .
in 1958 , the community was a so-called ' socialist planstadt ' directorate have been created for the defence research .
selenograd ( literally translated " grünstadt ' ) received its name from the forested hügellandschaft , are embedded in the research establishments .
stuttgart brake
the dimension of stuttgart 21 is not set high enough .
for the supporters of the project , it is purely and simply in order to ' the new heart of europe ' .
rightly so . s21 is much more than the tieferlegen a station , more than a gigantic construction project , the city of baden - württemberg capital for a decade ago in disarray will baustellenchaos down .
stuttgart 21 arose from the spirit of the 1980 's .
kopfbahnhöfe end up with lines , the in the middle of the city , at that time were hailed as the verkehrstechnische fossils in the nineteenth century , such as constraints of a modern rail transport , a lot of time , as it once needed forward umzuspannen , locomotives in the back .
simultaneously , very briefly , - so to travel further ´ s go .
and that is why the kopfbahnhöfe should disappear : in frankfurt and munich .
and in stuttgart : a durchfahrtsbahnhof , for the sake of such as the trans - european rail - magistrale route between paris / bratislava and budapest is - that is why the slogan ' the heart of europe ' .
s21 will , in fact , now tackled , although the visions of the 1980s , are no longer compatible with the reality .
itself very ambitious planners have recognised that , in the hessian and the bavarian [ hessischer rundfunk ] city , it is almost impossible to implement the tieferlegen .
kopfbahnhöfe do , however , also have no a - , and ausfahrtsproblem more , since it modern wendezüge with locomotives and steuerwagen at both ends .
nevertheless , stuttgart 21 along with the ice - neubaustrecke after ulm section , now will addressed .
country - and local politicians have pushed it through .
the railways power with , and also because the risks of the largest infrastructure - einzelprojekts of the republic of the taxpayers and not the staatskonzern contributes .
städtebaulich is the project is still reasonably justified .
there is new stadtraum , of - the computergenerierten tables illustrating the planners - believes that it will be equipped with a great deal of green .
rail is s21 harmful for the transport system .
the durchgangsbahnhof and the streckenausbau are intended for the passenger transport , which , typical 1980s , huge growth attributed .
at that time , there were not the competition from low - cost carriers .
modern transport policy , however , there must be first question , to strengthen the freight transport , as the transport is on the rail considerably environmentally - friendly than by lorry on the road .
but the neubaustrecke because of intense climbs is not fit to freight trains .
there is still a lot of serious is that s21 indirectly affected also many other rail .
a good eur six billion , in the schwäbischen verbuddelt be .
this is the official number .
experts 10 to 15 billion for realistic .
it is clear , in the next decade will lack the money to other hubs and engstellen in the network .
a total of 60 greater projects are on the list of transportation .
one of the most important is the development of the good 180 kilometres route through the rhine valley .
since 1987 is built on the route in slow .
would be necessary , as a matter of urgency , to push to the tube correctly here .
but s21 will act as a brake .
the rheintalstrecke will on the real bottleneck for the international freight transport : in the middle of the heart of europe .
government is examining verdict on the airport
the national government has in the wiesbadener landtag left open , whether they against the judgment of the hessian verwaltungsgerichtshofs [ hessischer rundfunk ] ( vgh ) will go to banning night flights in revision .
the cdu / german free democratic party ( fdp ) coalition have asked experts , is the more than 400 pages full vgh - judgment , to be legally examine said economics minister , mr dieter posch ( fdp ) .
the vgh on these days in kassel had justified in writing that the country in the case of the north - west runway at frankfurt airport planned construction of the new rules to the banning night flights .
the authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m. , as it offered the provincial government provides , is not with the legal protection of the population against noise at night to reconcile .
the coalition must decide until 4 january , whether it is against the judgment in revision .
the opposition criticized this postponement and to urge the representatives of the government , to give up on a revision of the bundesverwaltungsgericht in leipzig .
spd group torsten schäfer , gümbel called on the cdu and the fdp go back to their before the election promise made to return to a night curfew . otherwise it is as ' breach " to values .
it is hellishly difficult , if we must keep his word , greens said - head tarek al-wazir in reference to the german free democratic party ( fdp ) election slogan ' we believe that word ' .
minister posch , the accusation by schäfer - gümbel back , the national attempts , with ' rechtsverdreherei and sleight of hand " but to come to their night flights .
a precise legal examination need their time .
the coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a " rapid first impression ' .
we need a legally certain entscheiung , stefan müller ( fdp ) said .
so , as you is the opposition , are the statements of its never have been group to banning night flights .

rapid election
it was then but everything much faster than expected .
barely two weeks after the zdf board had urged the president - in- chief nicholas brender from the office , the sender can present a successor .
the vote on the personalie body wanted yesterday evening .
the favorite was peter frey , director of the zdf hauptstadtstudios in berlin .
it was a confirmation of the sender , however , not - officially in order to anticipate the procedure not .
however , have also played a role , the zdf - intendanten markus schächter not to damage further , this proposal should not be allowed to get away in the management board .
frey , schächters candidate , needs the support of nine of the 14 gremiummitglieder .
the outcome of the vote was not yet in print this edition .
in two weeks ago schächter was with its proposal , the treaty with nicholas brender failed in order to extend further five years , on the administrative board .
only seven members languages are in favour of brender , seven voted against him . brenders stepping down , was a heavy defeat for schächter , but a erwartbare .
because the unionsmehrheit weeks before the election , in the management board had already signalled , brender not to want to confirm in office .
had the organised resistance against the koch editor of the hessische prime minister roland .
with the argument that would have been under brender would have the news of the zdf lost ratings , it rejected a further term of office of the highly - regarded chefredakteurs .
there were therefore protests until shortly before the election , in which the political influence has been plaguing the zdf .
least had even 35 staatsrechtler interfered in the debate , the action the koch those deemed unconstitutional .
nothing came of it .
the person
peter frey was born on 4 august in bingen in 1957 .
he studied policy , teaching and romanistik .
then he worked in the südwestfunk and in the frankfurter rundschau .
in 1983 changed frey on zdf , firstly on the ' today - journal ' .
subsequent stations : in 1988 to 1990 personal advisor of chefredakteurs ; in 1991 / 92 correspondent in washington ; by 1998 head and facilitator of the ' morgenmagazins " ; until 2001 head the zdf - foreign policy ; since then director of the zdf hauptstadtstudios .
the greens , after the defeat brenders announced , on wednesday , has been elected by the branchenblatt medium magazine the journalists of the year , a complaint of unconstitutionality .
koch adversary in the management board , the rhineland - pfälzische prime minister kurt beck , stated in the last week , the countries should change the zdf - state treaty , so that personalvorschläge of intendanten cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority .
a withdrawal of party from the colleges of supervisors of the zdf castle , however , also beck from .
brenders heir peter frey had recommended the management board with a wise move - by the body immediately after the brender - stepping down , strongly criticised for that .
thanks to this belegs journalistic independence was both schächter it without loss of face for the post of president of the chefredakteurs and also the management board to choose , without in the suspicions , a partisan to coax into office .
in the parteiarithmetik will frey already classified as the liberal left - wing .

events would prevent ' .
the students , " would be entitled to receive , margins , allow the own initiative , and promote ' .
the rules should apply in the authorisation of new , but also in the existing review courses of study .
this must all be five years of " reakkreditiert " – what it means that takes until 2015 , however , have been reviewed until all the courses of study .
responsibility for are german ten accreditation agencies , which is subject to akkreditierungsrat set up by the countries .
the culture ministers had urged the countries in the october ' with emphasis ' , so as to bring influence to bear on the agencies that the not too big and prüfungsregime stofffülle is not to strict .
in individual länder , universities and colleges of higher education with landesministerien have already agreed on the appropriate measures .

more than a footnote to herta müller
in germany and from comment is beautiful ' almost no control ... is the anfangszeile of a poem of the lyrikers werner söllner , in which this issue in troubling sprachfetzen ankunftserfahrung of dissidents , the freedom won , but , at the same time , has lost his language .
the 1951 born in the romanian banat werner söllner had first of all , as german and englischlehrer - worked in a kinderbuchverlag in bucharest and , later , editor , before he 1982 to frankfurt am main relocated .
söllner is with various literaturpreisen he was excellent . in 1993 , the legendary frankfurter poetikvorlesungen at the goethe university , and since 2002 , it is , director of the hessian literaturforums [ hessischer rundfunk ] in mousonturm in frankfurt .
for considerable außerliterarisches attention , he during a meeting in munich last tuesday , in the ' german literature in romania in the mirror and zerrspiegel their securitateakten ' .
report visibly confused and move söllner read out a statement , in which he before rumäniendeutschen schriftstellerkollegen , including richard wagner , william totok , franz hodjak , and helmuth frauendorfer , its cooperation than in the for the romanian securitate security admitted .
together with some of the present had söllner in 1989 the german sprachpreis received .
the anwerbungsversuche have started by stealth , first 1971 .
so i am , closed söllner , ' someone who has campaigned against attempts to intimidate the securitate not enough . "
the lyricist werner söllner is in the walter .
almost at the same time with the nobelpreisehrung for herta müller and whose unprecedented literary debate with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule will the literaturszene and , in particular , the community of german originating from romania writers , shaken by a case , the plumb the depths and power , which indicated the property of a political system based on monitoring , and domestic spying .
werner söllner is , as far latest knowledge such that we can say , not only , but also the perpetrators victims .
in its securitate - acts have played a role in the walter , said after the confession söllners the literaturwissenschaftler michael markel and referred to the positive influence of in the walter for him .
he had it in all the sensitive points at the time for him , " markel bailed out ' .
it is a moral need him , this comment to make .
söllners statement was in the form and before this audience unexpected , quite surprising is the commitment of the former dissidents and its cooperation with the romanian secret services , however , not .
germany is a cosy reserve for securitate - have been informants , herta müller have already had in july , written in the time after it had read its own act , ; 914 sides , .
the people concerned , it must be suspect , speculation and will also have known , which in some case klarname behind the aliases sorin , voicu and it is also walter lay .
unlike the here now very verfahrenssicheren sighting the stasi - files , dealing with the legacy of securitate - monitoring still very diffuse .
a systematic information is thwarted in the past few years and has been hampered .
a the appropriate national council for getting to grips with the securitate birthler authority - files ( cnsas ) has been set up in 1999 , the launch of files has been rather slow since then however .
there is a law only since 2005 , regulates the the administration of files .
the influence that former securitate - members in romania is still a very large , after the announcement of the nobel peace prize for herta müller showed interview , in which a previous securitate - head from the temesvar dismissive about the received the prize was .
lastly , you have a psychosis , we have they only once interrogated .
the power of the infamy said is able to express quite openly in the shape of the freedom of expression here .
certainly raises in the case of söllner , as is so often the case in connection with verschwiegener blame , inevitable issues .
why only now ? who was harmed ? the listening to the measured response to söllners commitment gives hope that the continuation of this chapter of knowledge rather than apportioning blame and shame will be determined .
to genese the plant from herta müller , who yesterday has received the nobel peace prize , it is more than a footnote .

case kunduz

spd and left awareness of the chancellor are calling for .
hamburg / berlin - after the most recent findings on the air strikes of kunduz , the opposition has defense karl - theodor guttenberg ( csu ) to a deliberate deception .

traumwelten
in wachem state some seeing pictures and hear vote , does not see or hear the other .
not only to the mentally ill and in the drogenrausch blurring of the borders between fantasy and reality .
everything is in order as long as it happens , in their sleep .
if we are in our dark rooms with our eyes closed , we must have the wildest ideas and unchecked phantasiegebilden indulge .
however , those who experienced in the period traumartige conditions , sees things and listens , does not see or hear the other , is in the modern western world mostly as crazy or drug addiction , at least as a crank .
but images and vote of this kind arise not only on mental health or in the drogenrausch .
blame our imagination : has the same neural processes that enable us to draw up homes paint pictures , or to write novels , sometimes have to ensure that the borders between the dream , madness and reality are becoming increasingly blurred .
traumartig modified wachbewusstseinszustände in the different forms can occur in the best - case scenario , we call them visions and , in the worst case , madness .
even if the trigger and effect may , the different visions of mystikerin hildegard of bingen , the drogenerlebnisse of new - age - prophet carlos castaneda , schamanische entrückungszustände , psychoses and hallucinations but attributable to similar processes .
hallucinations or delusions arise , if the balance of neural , of the brain - above all , dopamin , , serotonin and noradrenaline acetylcholin derailment - and the interaction of various gehirnteile is disturbed .
complex hallucinations and wahnhafte idea are very often during a schizophrenic psychosis .
the force of gravity has no more about him power
the context of madness and dream has philosophers and medical professionals since antiquity .
aristotle concept hallucinations as a form of dream in the state , wilhelm griesinger , one of the founder of modern psychiatry , stated 1861 a " great similarity of the irreseins with traumzuständen ' , the dream of sigmund freud was even ' a psychosis , with all the inconsistencies , wahnbildungen , sinnestäuschungen of such a " .
it is autumn of 2001 , when henning t. transformed into a comicfigur .
be body is developed along two dimensions and quietschbunt .
the force of gravity has no more about him power , it is hanging in the zimmerdecke .
it senses enters a .
behind him produce teufelsgestalten with blutroten , distorted fratzen , zähnefletschend .
they hunting him , it with serious , inflammatory boots , throw it against the walls , it feels the pain on the whole body .
noisy , malicious vote roar from walls and radio .
it may no longer bear them , the votes , the abuse at him and insult .
henning t. is tearing two cable out of the stereo , knotet you attached to a noose and to you a crux of the ceiling .
it is rising on a loudspeaker and is tightening the noose around the neck .
too .
the noose is disappearing .
the vote you should be a lesson the cry out ' go in the clinic in trommelfellzerfetzendem choir , and let you cure ' .
today is henning t. 40 years old , it is six acute psychosis seen , the last is 2 years back , the first almost 20 years .
it has been triggered by lsd .
his diagnosis is schizoaffektive - paranoid psychosis , it is also , it takes depressed bi - medicines , against the depression , the mania , the schizophrenia .
he has learned to live with his illness , married for three years it is .
in the worst fear and deepest despair psychosis i have seen , he says .
the mere empty words are ongoing , cruel reality
approximately one per cent of the population ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia , in psychiatric clinics , it will be treated as second disease after the depression .
in an acute schizophrenic psychosis can affected more often than not distinguish more between domestic and the outside world , they get trapped in a übererregten state of affairs that to hallucinations , sizes - , can lead relationships or persecution .
this is particularly widespread stimmenhören - vote , the orders , comment or dialogisieren .
also optical hallucinations are not infrequently .
not more of the affected can important trivial to separate the brain , not more cost of purging , the system can disturbing signals awareness is being inundated of the impressions .
such as the dream opens the psychosis the floodgates for a spate of ideas and fantasies , the deeper bewusstseinsschichten come from .
the perceive reality in the psychosis is subjektzentriert , says professor thomas fox , general psychiatry oberarzt the clinic in universitätsklinikum heidelberg .
the schizophrenic is in the centre of the loop , everything has an importance directed at him .
at the same time , it is in a passive role , it will , in a similar overwhelmed dream , of what is happening and can you not actively shape .
schizophrenic therefore often feel threatened , controlled and manipulated .
a realitätsabgleich you is often not possible , the mere empty words are excluded cruel reality , wake up .
once in their lives to have seen a hallucinations
unlike in the dream , fox says , " remains but the sinnliche and geographical structure of reality , the perceived in the psychosis will be given , in principle . "
the obsession thoughts and in reality , the verfremdung based hallucinations of the erlebens will take place at the real framework .
exactly why our brains vagaries , , researchers is still proposing puzzle .
in each people ausnahmezustände can lead that he loses the reality in the short term , fox says .
but not everyone will develop a psychosis .
there seem to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia , but zwillingsstudien have shown that the genes are not the alone are determining factors .
researchers are out of them from that , when affected minimal brain damage .
we suspect that the neuronal maturing of the brain at an early stage of development will be disrupted , by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy , for example , explained fox .
but there remain a puzzle , such as the disruption of the neural system comes into existence , is also the first manifestiere does not even for many years .
also environmental can play a role - of stress or traumatic experiences a trigger for psychosis be , if there is the negotiable .
especially hallucinogens drugs can also trigger psychoses , because they interfere in the transmittersystem .
if our brain hotly is
the stupidity is , psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medicines , in order to get rid of them , others are spending money on drugs from , in order to get them , says the lübecker psychologieprofessor erich castes .
whether as a pleasant or unpleasant be mere empty words , is often only a question of the position .
castes collects since reports on hallucinations and trugerscheinungen ten years ago , in last year he has its results , in the book " the unreal world in our head ' evaluated .
hallucinations belong to the typical effects of psychoses , but also from surprisingly many other diseases .
this includes mental disorders , such as often also , diseases such as migraine borderline or depression , epilepsy and multiple sclerosis or alzheimer 's and schädelhirntraumata .
surprisingly hallucinates under certain conditions even the brain healthy people .
hallucinations , so castes , from the gedächtnisinhalten , which normally be withheld .
they arise , when areas in which have sensory are processed , are blocked überaktiv or too little ; if our brains also hotly is or , if stimulation is lacking .
drugs can trigger this state as such as brain damage or an psychosis .
but also reizentzug , stress , liebeskummer or other mental ausnahmezustände .
recent studies have been up to a third of those polled said that at least once in their lives to have seen a hallucinations .
in the summer of 2005 , sarah k. 16 years old , they live in a small town in mecklenburg - vorpommern visited and the secondary school there .
a very normal girls , in fact .
if there would not be the pictures and the vote .
it can happen that in the break a schlaksiger young with long , dark hair addresses it .
if it responds to the classmates look at it surprised - nobody else does this see or hear young .
you believe that the timid girls for a versponnene tagträumerin , but sarah k. not dreaming , it knows it .
it is awake , you can see and hear these young , just as the girls in the bank in addition , they can see and hear .
you can feel his presence even , at least for moments .
a pleasant this feeling is that they may the young .
i am crazy ? , you sometimes wonder .
but you know , of course , that this young and the other is not mere empty words are real and disappear again .
at night , the phenomena are often frightening
the mere empty words are often also a burden .
if you in the classroom sitting you not sometimes , can the unterrichtsstoff consequences , because the teachers in their eyes and ears just presenting a new classmates , while for all other visual and visible at the banqueting table mathematical equations explained .
at night , the phenomena are often frightening .
if you waiting for the sleep in their dark room , which is , of course , far too rarely and come too late , it can often not distinguish between , whether it is awake or already dreams , whether the images which it sees the fratzen or the girls with the bleeding schnittwunden of poor and legs , before their open or eyes closed .
let me is crying out in a calm , they to shape the .
nothing of the parents and friends told you would think it is crazy .
autumn of 2009 . sarah k. is 20 years old today .
it has in the last year the insisted baccalaureate and live together with your friend .
in a year , the hallucinations have stopped .
since you contact with the psychologists castes , on the internet , you know that it is not crazy .
madness is also a work of art from despair
if someone is socially isolated or under reizentzug suffers , has it with great likelihood , after a while hallucinations , says castes .
i suspect , then the brain is under , and even for his entertainment .
sarah k. , a einzelkind , had as a young girl , fear of other children , often , she played alone .
their hallucinations , as you began with 13 learned that the man that they can daddy calls , since they thinking , is not their leiblicher father .
because in visual and acoustic hallucinations same hirnbereiche , are active in this process , it is also real impressions and noise affected as sarah k. hard to distinguish , mere empty words and reality ' every see , " castes , says . ' will take place in the brain , the reality is there .
hallucinations are also images , which the brain arise , it is therefore they so real . "
at night images also sees caste as a form of hallucinations .
the hallucinations of healthy are not fundamentally different from those an acute psychosis .
in contrast to schizophrenic are mentally healthy in the situation , to recognise their mere empty words as divorced from reality .
castes advises his patients , therefore , that the hallucinations also value as a special ability .
grenzzustand between dream and hallucinations
in our to very bewusstseinszentrierten world will see imaginary often , alas , pathologizing , says mr schmidt - degenhard , professor in heidelberg and psychotherapy chefarzt the clinic of psychiatry and of the florence nightingale - hospital in düsseldorf .
a psychosis is a serious , painful disease , but it has also positive , creative - madness is also a work of art out of desperation .
schmidt - degenhard has the so-called oneiroide erlebnisform researched , a particular form of traumartig modified wachbewusstseins .
oneiroide are very complex , detailed quasi - dreams , the the erlebende for real , and the he , in retrospect cannot distinguish the wakefulness .
the oneiroide bewusstseinszustand arises in trauma or illness extreme , for example in polyradikulitis patients , the experience in full awareness of a motor paralysis .
if a person of itself - and weltverlust is threatened , such as , for example , by continuing total impotence , it replaces the life reality by its own , imagined world , the is decoupled away from reality , says schmidt - degenhard .
a kind of grenzzustand between dream and hallucinations .
given that the deal with a situation in the reality is not possible , a weltwechsel is taking place , but reality will envisage in the imagination .
an intensive form of sinnstiftung and meaning in a intolerable situation , the people own destiny , allows us not submerged in nothing of the bewusstseinsverlustes .
everything is real , later in the memory
also the zürcher art peter cornelius claussen describes his oneiroid - experiences in his book the soul ' herzwechsel ' as a bailout .
it is 49 years old , as its awareness for a herzklappenoperation followed by a heart transplant posted on travel , while his body on the intensive care is condemned to a standstill .
a , in a world selbstgeschaffene claussen appears visited foreign times and places : they experience as a zugsanatoriums bettlägerigen , old mann , on board , a robot guards his health .
he lives in the early middle ages under royal , the manufacture of drugs from blood .
will of a greeks on the motorcycle abducted in whose own country , is with his spitalbett surfing the firnschnee of the alps and is a korean mafioso .
it is entirely to be done in the imagined that everything is real , later in the memory .
this internal travel for claussen are fundamentally different from any dream .
dream is a other state , be he describes see .
quite the contrary , i have memories of travel mental nor after years and in secondary details abundantly clear .
clearer and more even than really happened .
the intensity of this erlebens goes beyond the horizon of our other lebensweltlichen experience , says the psychiatrists schmidt - degenhard .
at the end of the day , show oneiroide , psychoses , hallucinations and drogenrausch , how fragile our internal reflections of external reality also in the ensure are .
any change of the bewusstseinszustandes , to summarise the psychologist castes , " can lead to impervious a distortion of reality , what we call ' .
a experience , the well can also be enriching .

mazda3 i stop : environmentally - friendly athleticism
mazda would like to prove that converted athleticism is perfectly compatible with the protection of the environment .
for this reason has mazda recently in the converted model mazda3 christened the automatic stop - and anfahrsystem of the motors , introduced on the behalf i - stop , at the moment , a device that however only for the 2.0 petrol with 150 ps available .
this second generation of the mazdas 3 stands out is through their good marks in the overall picture .
the final processing , the implementation of the vehicle , of the comfort , be straβenverhalten , the mechanics , the i - stop system ...
all these aspects are the new mazda3 ' very good ' .
starting with the front , we can see that the front seats provide an excellent good ergonomics and stop good .
it is also the game of lenkrads excellent .
in view of the unity , the further out of the instrumententafel and the armaturenbrett is , we can see , that mazda with a wide range of converted and switchgear in the impact of the colours red and blue , at the same lines as the japanese trend towards a futuristic innendesign .
this style partly reminds us of the style of the honda civics .
therefore , can easily be said that , both the mazda 3 , as well as the civic , both converted japanese models , of of the coldness of german automobiles , especially from the volkswagen gulf , the all want to exceed withdrawals .
the passenger compartment of these two japanese kompaktwagen offers more than ever the appropriate comfort , so that four adults äuβerst conveniently able to travel with the car .
to all this is a groβräumiger and clear alliance boot .
the stop - and anfahrsystem is up to now , only the 2 litres of petrol with 150 ps available and of 6 - gear .
this driving force is a real benefit from . he stands by its points , by its quiet sounds , his achievements and by its low consumption .
and all those who drive not many kilometres a year , this should stop with petrol engines i - whether because of its groβen comfort in gear and its low consumption , even if for mazda , above all , the dieselmodelle converted the best are to take into consideration .
in terms of equipment , it is for the test the so-called model sportive selected a special , since it a much gröβere number of elements from the serienausstattung has .
from the serienaustattung stands out above all , the assistant for the fahrspurwechsel ( rvm ) , so that the dead abolishes corner , but also the bedienelemente for the traction and stability , the geschwindigkeitsregelung , the light innenspiegel , the bordcomputer with a groβen screens , the sensors to park , an independent air conditioning , rain and lichtsensoren , access and audio - access , as well as the verchromten 17 - the customs - wheels .
auβerdem includes this version still , as if it not yet enough of resources , the package premium , which would be for an additional eur 1 500 contains the following : in addition to further elements , above all , the lernfähigen bixenon - headlamps and the soundsystem bose with cd - lader .
conclusion
the mazda3 2.0 i - stop is one of the best kompaktwagen its class .
it is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used , because of its driving patterns and the diversity of resources .
auβerdem those who are not many kilometres a year to go , also buy the i - stop version , the only with a 2.0 petrol with 150 ps is available .
the only be negative in this model is but a high price , of between eur 21.770 for the model luxury and 23.270 euro for the probegefahrene model sportive is .
in return to this high price , however , the mazda3 offers us every day in the new highest fahrspass .
a first with a great deal of ' glamour '
l. example is the red tepppich the sensuality for penélope cruz , nicole kidman and fergie from .
in the premiere of ' nine ' resonated with the stars , clothed in models , which will be as elegantly as sexy . ( photographs , more than ever before : gtresonline ) .
our ' pe ' , so elegantly , as always , opted for a dark " lady ' - dress .
the promises of fonpeek
peek is limited äuβerst , a device , with the can only be read his e- mails , without a possibility , able to see certain annexes or able to surf around the internet .
it has its five minutes enjoyed glory , when it the magazine time chose to one of the products of the year .
it is on the straβe to see , is unlikely to be , but the idea in itself is nevertheless especially for young people of interest .
in contrast to the smart phones peek only costs very little , and has a very favourable unmetered access , for example , just the half the prize of a iphone the flat rate .
after the companies has seen the success of that , there has two new equipment placed on the market : one , which is intended only for twitter , the other with a lifelong gratisservice for data , unlike the peek , in which they have to pay a price six times higher .
fonpeek , which was presented yesterday in the event le web , the european version of this invention and is thus your third version .
it has the same borders , however , as his american counterpart , has a surprise crisis .
the monthly unterhaltspreis for the telephone , around eur 12 the month , roaming includes for the whole of europe .
those who travel with a smartphone around the world , know already , what it means , on all the data must to do , in order to be able to read his e- mails , as soon as it has ridden roughshod over the border , or when we desperately looking after a café with wifi ( or a access with fon ) .
the idea of the roaming with flat rate is incredibly tempting and really should be possible for a long time .
it is true that some telephone providers already specific treaties and prices for offer abroad , but in my experience , we need already a doctorate in physics and a good glasses in order to be able to read all of this small print .
the repeated criticism on the part of the european commission in relation to affordable roaming charges for the whole of europe were almost always ignored .
auβerhalb own country has always be afraid of it to read his e- mails and rightly so .
that a small device as fonpeek ( with it but always astonishing is that it has the behalf fon , even though it does not have a wifi / wlan ) can offer this kind of tariffs , that means the telephone providers slowly but surely , is a rethink and must start in various possibilities to consider , as you can use their cyber .
kindle is another good example of this , in its prices is the downloaded of books and other questions contained in the internet .
without vetrag and without snags .
this is a internetfähiges device and we will be paying only a single time , namely the purchase , and not month by month .
and that is exactly what it is , what i expect , also one day of fonpeek , a kaufmöglichkeit with lifelong internet access as offering the peek already in the united states .
and that is not because i would like to buy it .
i would like to thank my e- mails , with the telephone read .
but i expect this , because i am of the opinion that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer .
it would be interesting , with the same time a computer system able to see .
the fetischfarbe of michelle
yellow is , without a doubt , the lieblingsfarbe of the american first lady .
already in the office of barack obama as president of the united states they have appeared in a dress and re- elected a mantle of the colour and has the same colour , in order to him in his , without doubt , second moment in his life to accompany : the award of the nobel peace prize in oslo .
michelle obama has very similar models on two occasions : auβer that it was almost the same colour - a shining grüngelb - , was the clothes from three parts - dress , jacket and umbrella from the same substance , and it has contributed something groβförmig gesticktes or a halskette .
it even goes so far as , for the first sight it seems that the first lady of the united states had wanted to follow the example of the princess of asturias and had decided , the same dress in more than just an occasion to bear .
however , the two clothes are very different in the stoffart , from which they are prepared .
in the inauguration it has a dress from head and in oslo one from gemusterten along with .
the accessories were also different : the first time green footwear with halbhohen paragraphs and the second time , although a änhliches model , but goldfarben .
also the hair was different : every time the hair were on this occasion as haarkranz high , with the previous it has the hair openly .
75 % of the working mothers have because of their maternity problems are given in the work
the discrimination in the work has increased in the past years , especially in the younger women , the want to have children .
to this is the result of csic study carried out in cooperation with the institute for women ' fertility and career of women in spain ' .
the survey 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt in that respect : 75 % of working women see their career prospects in the labour market restricted because of their motherhood .
the study , open , that there is a very broad differences in the decision to start a family , and the number of children are , according to whether or not the women work and if so , what kind of profession they exercise .
those of you who auβerhalb of the house not carry out other work , only part-time work or no fixed contract , are more likely to become mothers and have more children .
in contrast , the women postpone , with a fixed employment , particularly in the public sector , the creation of a family and motherhood , and that is why we have also fewer children .
' the women in the age group between 35 and 49 years , with a fixed employment get their first child on average only 3.7 years after the pooling , a number , which to 4.1 years for women with firm increased employment , to have the taken longer to achieve this , and the pooling it and the first child is only have achieved much later .
auβerdem also has the kind of work a groβen influence on motherhood , although less than the calendar with regard to the empfängnisbereitschaft , " says the csic - researcher , margarita delgado .
the level of education is a further factor , in the age of the women must be taken into account when the marriage and the first child .
according to the survey the age is the time of the marriage and the first child , the higher the higher the level of education .
this difference could also be found in the same age women .
for example , the women in the group between 35 and 49 years ago , according to whether they have only the or completed a higher education , on average each with 25,1 or 32,1 for the first time mother .
in addition , there is still , according to their level of education , a further difference between the women .
while the women with hauptschlussabschluss before their first marry permanent jobs and have their first child , make it the women with a medium- sized or high secondary education exactly the other way around and seek out only a permanent jobs and marry later and will receive their first child , delgado notes .

cowardly aggression
my 70 -year-old mother came last week by our part in the municipality of fuenlabrada walking , when , suddenly , a group of young people between 15 and 18 years in addition to their and our dog herliefen , our dog is a mischling that we have obtained from the rescue and the just six kilo is , and then you from the blue missed him two fußtritte and injured it so difficult .
it is not our outrage in words , since it is us incomprehensible , where since the spass in a cheap agression against a small and defenceless animals should be , which has of course been carried out at the leash .
in addition to the erstickungsanfall that a madam , was walking the cosy , was given , as it wanted to these people because of the reprimanding incident , it feared even for their own lives , because if such a raving attacked a dog , it is also , the same perhaps with a mr or mrs of a child , an old probably even with every make , of the weaker than it is in itself .
the incident occurred in a normally calm neighbourhoods in a very ordinary tuesday at five o'clock in the afternoon .
the dog has the whole day geheult .
of course , we have in , but of a nahgelegenen police force , we have reported grave doubts about whether that will bring anything at all and in order to prevent any prejudice from the outset , we only want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals spaniards were .
our indignation about what has happened has led us , this incident .
we can not to understand what must be in the minds of these young people , that they find a cheap attack on a defenceless animals fun , of an animal , the us love , there is society , and friendship .
we know not where the good education and the respect for the animals and the people have remained .

the sale of vans rising to regain some degree of
after almost two years the car market for light something at long last begins to see the light at the end of the dark tunnel .
the 9.425 vehicles , which were admitted in november in spain , mean an increase of 12.6 % in relation to the year 2008 , and , what is still much more important is that they are so that the first increase at all after 22 with constant decline , gemäβ the successive months by the herstellerverband anfac and the autohändlerverband ganvam presented figures .
however , these good figures are time only with groβer caution to genieβen , since the benchmark used for the comparison of november 2008 , which are particularly bad verkausjahr with a 60 % decline in respect of the previous year was .
we must remember , however , that , apart from the rise in the last month , the gesamtzulassungen this still 11 months of 40 % below the sales of the previous financial year .
since january , as a whole were 95.853 vehicles sold , in this number , but all vehicles , from which the kleintransportermarkt is , include : descendants of cars , pick - ups , vans , small vans and easier vans / chassis .
furthermore , are still in the sky , the same storm clouds what impact the demand in the most , because even if some of the vehicles purchased by individuals , the groβteil of sales to small and medium- sized enterprises , which in the purchase nearly 100 % of all cases with a third .
so we must these restrictions , which are the result of the zugedrehten flow of the banks , to further factors with einschlieβen , such as the increase in the rate of unemployment or the continuation of the poor economic situation .
in this panorama and , in the difference to cars that have the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the plan 2000e little helped .
this determines plan is not , however , only for individuals , including self- employed and small companies to have a right , if they are a light up to 3.5 tonnes with a co2 ausstoss , which must not exceed 160 grams per mileage , want to buy , but the low sales speak for themselves .
just yesterday had ganvam again remind you that , it is absolutely necessary , is also a special emphasis on the part of the state in this light , and also , of course , on the industriefahrzeuge ( lorries and buses ) .
the autohändlervereinigung predicted for the year 2010 as the just last a similar year , for which it with a verkaufsausfall ( passenger cars and offroad vehicles put expected ) by 19 % .
the support in bremsmanövern in critical situations is duty
as was already in the antiblockierbremssystem ( and how is it now happening with the stability esp , must have an intervention systems to be a requirements in the european cars brakes in emergencies .
in fact , they are already duty in all newly registered passenger cars and light light commercial vehicles , for the remaining a karenzfrist until the end of february 2011 was set .
the maβnahme has adopted by the european union on the objective , but to improve the protection of the fuβgänger , can also help these braking systems because their functioning , to prevent many front - rear collisions .
the task of the emergency braking is to put more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical bremsmanövers , which the system by the bremsstärke outlined by the drivers on the brake recognises , to exercise .
however , this system is not until the end of this pressure .
according to a commissioned by the komponentenhersteller for the bosch vehicles study , a third of the drivers involved in an accident was not before the zusammenstoss even more to do it , on the brake to enter into force and half of them had not with full force slowed down .
up to 1.100 accidents
the bremshilfe against intervenes with maximum force in the braking system and reduced by the bremszeit and bremsabstand , therefore , the brakes are also a car in the applied traveled .
according to a study by the eu could up to 1.100 fatal accidents every year , in which fuβgänger harm to come , be prevented , if all cars equipped with this type of emergency braking would be .
it would be even less accidents - it is estimated that every fourth accident with personal injury could be prevented - as soon as the so-called intelligent notbremssysteme be popular .
then the vehicle is equipped with a system , the ( on radars or a camera ) obstacles recognizes the driver and cautions , with it at the same time a light put pressure on the brakes .
if the driver responded , is helping him to in the system , to increase the pressure on the brake , if it would be necessary .
if the drivers not respond to the warning and even if the zusammenstoss already is inevitable , is the bremsassistent the put maximum pressure on the brakes , so that in this way to keep the damage as low as possible .
general motors postpones the plan for opel until january
while the workforce of the opel plant in figueruelas ( zaragoza ) already by nick reilly , the new chairman of general motors ( gm ) europe , have been informed that the production of the meriva new at will start in the first aprilwoche , probably on 8 , according to javier ortega , the american car manufacturers of pointing out that it needs more time in order to bring the rescue plan for opel to a conclusion .
nick reilly , the new chairman of gm europe , namely wants to achieve that the side affected their assent on each individual point of the plan is already in advance .
and for this reason , it may be that the final document , that first , the workers , and then there are the governments of the countries , in which it works , will be presented until will postpone in early 2010 .
dementgegen will by gm assured that , in the next few days , it will take a decision regarding the sale of saab .
since it is not surprising that the swedish government has increased the pressure on the american car manufacturers , so that this a decision as soon as possible .
to , gm are to be in contact with a number of possible new buyers .
an this buyers could be geely , which also would like to buy up volvo , however , the skyper - the option of dutch manufacturer sports , which has the backing of the russian group converg , attracting an ever - greater .
if it should come to an agreement with any of these buyers , gm some assets to the chinese baic could sell .
the decision to schlieβen saab the end of the year , if it is not been sold until then , will continue to maintain .
at the wheel of the porsche boxster spyder
for the development of their latest and very expensive jewel used by the engineers the boxster s as a basis , and , really managed to make things easier for him to 80 kilos , which he now only 1.275 kilos brings to the balance .
in order to create something renunciation , as a first , you on the automatic aufklappbare roof , which has been replaced by a zeltleinwanddach with manuellem impetus , so that we alone has , thanks to the 21 kilo saved when this model used aluminiumtüren such as the gt3 ' disappearance ' further 15 ; by the exclusion of the air conditioning 13 once again ; auβerdem one has the kraftstofftank from 64 to 54 litres , so that further 7 kilos have been reduced ; saved by the installation of sporting bacquet time - are still 12 and with the slight 19 - customs - wheels again saved five .
you then had also been exacerbated by the renunciation of the audio - system 's cdr - 30 once again six kilos of less and through the exchange of türgriffe achieved by the lack of kilo handles from substance .
although it also with the doppelkupplungsgetriebe pdk available is , the test was carried out with a vehicle with 6 - conventional handgetriebe , mainly on the smaller landstraβen of california , to bergstrecken , the really were very kurvig .
in his driving behaviour we can only give the mark irreproachable him .
the reduction of its weight , but not to no longer so sure geführtdass he now would be on the straβe .
it is rather the opposite is the case : since we have already not long more as a small and light model probegefahren , the a but at the same time , it is a feeling of groβer security in the bends , even in high speed .
it is a small athlete , to be able to flex its muscles in a low motion in the time required to make warm , until we give him the orders to head to curb to recover and then , again to get everything from his engine ...
he makes everything , what he says . the car power everything , with our hands what we him the steering wheel indicate that , thanks to its management , which is as communicative as also precise .
and he makes it with the precision of a surgeons .
a motorsound for all tastes
the sound of his v6 boxers with 320 ps ( 10 more than the boxster s ) is very have been able and it can it be increase with the ' sport ' - option and by means of a system that the motorgeräusche can change , which has already in the panamera was for the first time .
the beschleunigungsvermögen is inconceivable brutally , regardless of whether from the are or renewed speed up .
the federungen strong , however , are not severe or inconvenient .
the asphalt on the landstraβen , on which we with the boxster spyder went , quite was already damaged , but the car meisterte the bumps well .
the electronic assistants had on the whole route almost nothing to do ; and that , although we in some of these trends of ice in the early hours of the morning and rollsplitt found this morning .
in summary we can say that it is a ultraleichtes car , a car , with which to indescribable fahrspass has , as it otherwise it is rather rare and there is much more than just a small improvement in him of the boxster ss .
the car will come in february 2010 on the market and will cost eur 70.831 .

the team from vitoria could the significant defaults of herrmann , oleson , huertas or micov by means of a very broad dose to use and replace teamwork , even if you wait until the bitter end to its victory muβten .

mr the team of ivanovic , violated , but anything other than dead , a few prepare gambits with accuracy had to once again , in order to get air and in one of them the suddenly emerged gun of mirza teletovic , with three almost successive triple and with the support of english and ribas ensured that on the anzeigentafel by ( 54 - einberuhigender distance to 67 ) been notified , the host at the end of the third quarter with ( 57 - enhance 67 ) could .
the alavesen were in the last quarter of bloβgestellt and english and san emeterio ( 60 - 75 ) , already announced that they would allow anyone , to give you the victory that you , in the first dreiβig minutes honest deserved , taking back .
nevertheless resigned pnini and eidson , not the best of their team and tried , your team by three points of the line ( 70 - 77 ) force to be .
nevertheless , and although mote because fouls being the place was asked , mr the team of ivanovic was not on , defended well and although the israelis nor in the last minute aufholten ( 80 - 85 ) , the game have already had lost a victors and tel aviv for the first time in this season .

olympiacos was of the intensity of the ereins unicaja surprised , even if the local team with a innenspiel between bourousis , vujcic and schortsanitis managed that the anzeigentafel in the 13 minute 22 - 20 in their favour anzeigte , the minute , in the it as a result of an action almost to the affray between the two americans beverley and would have been to williams and which is why both disqualified have been .
the greek team began , warm weather at last to be , and its superiority on both spielhälften , while the departure of the englishman , mr joel freeland as a result of a violation of , and the three itself mistake by carlos jiménez caused significant traces in the unicaja hinterlieβen .

many thanks !
after the tempting days since last spring , in which the inflation of assets the prevailing mood on the markets has been returned , on the markets is the insecurity , which is in any case surprising , since this is their natural state , in an environment in which the broker take decisions on an inherently uncertain future .
it was the maβnahme used to stabilise the markets , to pay the debt with the direktkauf of assets and indirectly to let the liquidity free hand in interest rates , the move to the zero claim , so that in this way the banks assets to buy .
the central banks have already confirmed that the direktkäufe of assets as well as an end and , without their heterodox policy to liquidity in question , start to diversify , some sand in the wheels , as the bce näc already vormachte with their jahresversteigerung , the next week .
therefore the investors doubt the capacity of the world economy , the economic recovery without this heterodox maβnahmen maintain and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premia .
the increase in the unternehmensboni flüchtigkeiten of the stock exchanges and the differences between again , even if they are still far removed from the paranormalen amounts , the they achieved at the beginning of the year .
the member states have been forced to nationalize the private risks and the national debt rise again .
we will now again on quality and the united states , japan and germany , are the privileged shelter of the investors , which will result in an increase of the differences in respect of the countries of the euro area to germany .
spain has until now hardly affected by this episode of instability , but then came standard & poor 's and threatened with a new revision downwards in the assessment of spain .
on the other hand , a degree of uncertainty is detrimental not , in order to silence the defenders of the moral risk , once again had tried , in the leaders of the global economic an awareness had caused , for what you , to produce , since the devastating effects , to which the restriction of credits had led to the loss of jobs , slowed down , than you actually a new day for the dankesaktion beschlieβen should have .
nevertheless , what has happened in dubai , via a stammeskrieg between the emiren , in order to restore the power in the emirates and the development in greece was also foreseen earlier .
a government , which conceals the public debt , elections , and a new government , which the same thing .
prodi made in italy there berlusconi and sócrates in portugal , mr barroso .
it makes no sense that ecofin hungary at the beginning of the year from non- save their external and thus granting a euro - member state , not to honour its commitments .
however , it is logical that ecofin has forced the greek government , to be transparent and its citizens to the need for auβergewöhnlicchen maβnahmen with in the duty to take , in order to maintain the stability of the state money .
yes , we are as expected a episode of normalisation of risk premiums , after some excesses to high amounts are , it would now within the expected .
in the case of spain , we must not worry , as long as the differences of public debt with the same speed as the european unternehmensboni increase .
but should reduce the differences between the european and are , to continue to increase the spanish dannn would act it is a special spanish risk .
the standard & poor 's is a farce . while the volume of this early indicators a groβteil of the marktforschungsinstitute obliges us to do so , their scenarios for the recovery , it would be preferable and their scenario for 2011 to be revised upwards , einschlieβlich the ocde and the european commission , which once with a japanese scenario promises for the spanish economy , all this despite warnings not long life span .
once again , it is the seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy spanish share , although at the moment as ' caution drive ' is needed .

the chairman of iberdrola , ignacio sánchez galán , as the first met yesterday before the subcommittee of the parliament , where in these days the strategy in relation to the energy supply spain will be debated in the next two decades .
after his occurs in the gas natural - fenosa , the chairman of rafael villaseca followed , some stichpunkte galán the press was about what he had put to the subcommittee on behind versschlossenen doors .
according to the chairman of iberdrola euround 50 billion by 2020 , spain must invest further from this date 60 billion between now and 2030 , under the pretext that the current nuclear power stations also continue to remain in operation .
this should not be the case , would not be on the investments needed 60 billion , but up to 95 billion .
iberdrola , however , is of the opinion that we should not invest more in an increase in the energy , but in distribution networks and international groupings .
from 2020 onwards , the question will change and we should increase the performance .
his proposal focuses on both gas and kohlewerke with facilities for capture of co2 and above all , of course , on the renewable energy sources .
in this case , it assumes that 18 000 mw more are needed , under the vorraussetzungnatürlich by other ' stützenergien ' .
galán is , of the opinion that the gesetentwurf for a sustainable economy , which has just adopted by the government , is in line with what his company has called for , in no case wanted to say something against this law , such as incentives for the national kohleverbrauch to create , which is the exact opposite of all the political strategies in the fight against climate change would be .
his opinion , ' the long term , has made it clear in this direction , despite some ' individual ' maβnahmen , as you described the chairman of iberdrola .
be that as it is galán believes that we , as of now , the decisions to the investments , even if these are long term , should make , because it will need some time and a stable pay package must be created , in order to tackle them .
